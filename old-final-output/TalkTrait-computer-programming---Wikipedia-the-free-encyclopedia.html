<h2>Proposed Deletion</h2>
<p>I would propose this article be merged into Abstract Types rather than sitting on its own. Traits are a behavoir variant of abstract types. EvanCarroll (talk) 20:04, 23 June 2009 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Traits come from the Self programming language" &lt;-- evidence? Schaerli et al at the SCG implemented traits in Smalltalk (Squeak 3.9, to be precise). --Frank Shearar (talk) 20:07, 28 July 2011 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Traits come from the Self programming language" &lt;-- I think this is wrong. self does have a thing conventionally called "traits" but it not the same kind of thing as this page is speaking of. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 64.186.37.5 (talk) 20:35, 28 July 2011 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Traits come from the Self programming language" &lt;-- I coined the term "trait", in this usage, as a developer/manager on the Xerox "Star" in 1979/80. Object-orientation, classes and traits were implemented as coding patterns over the system language Mesa. Conceptually, they were atomic packages of methods, antecedent to "class". Concept was influenced by ideas from Smalltalk/multiple inheritance and polymorphism at PARC. Fine grained reuse seemed necessary for Star because the target operating environment was so small (e.g., .5MB-.75MB main memory). I published a Xerox PARC "blue-and-white" report on traits in 1981/2, and published at SIGOA the following year  GCurry (talk) 21:36, 10 October 2011 (UTC)</p>
<p>I support GCurry's comment above. I've discussed this with the researchers who implemented traits in Smalltalk and they said Gael Curry and Xerox Star is where traits began (source is personal email discussion). They also point to: <i>G. Curry, L. Baer, D. Lipkie, and B. Lee. Traits: An approach to multiple-inheritance subclassing. In SIGOA conference on Office Information Systems, pages 1–9, Philadelphia, Pennsylvannia, USA, 1982. ACM Press"" --Overseasexile (talk) 20:11, 27 January 2013 (UTC)</i></p>
<h2>Trait with variables?</h2>
<p>"Does not specify any state variables."</p>
<p>Really? Some Scala traits do: http://ideone.com/U1gIx</p>
<p>It is funny that Scala is listed in examples of such languages, although Scala's traits are different from described traits. <small>— Preceding unsigned comment added by V6ak (talk • contribs) 11:38, 7 June 2012 (UTC)</small></p>
<p>Most people understand traits from the Smalltalk research in this field and the original Smalltalk implementation specifically excluded traits having state. Since then the researchers realized this was an error, but I don't believe there's been any definitive method (no pun intended) of describing how state should be implemented. --Overseasexile (talk) 19:53, 27 January 2013 (UTC)</p>
