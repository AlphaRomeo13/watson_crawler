<h1>Factory method pattern</h1>
<p>In class-based programming, the <b>factory method pattern</b> is a creational pattern which uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. This is done by creating objects via calling a factory method—either specified in an interface and implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by derived classes—rather than by calling a constructor.</p>

<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>The factory method pattern should <i>not</i> be confused with the more general notion of factories and factory methods. The factory method pattern is the best-known use of factories and factory methods, but not all uses of factory methods are examples of the factory method pattern – only when inheritance is involved (a class implementing an interface, or derived class, implements a factory method) is it an example of the factory method pattern. More basic uses of factories are not examples of the factory method pattern, and may instead be referred to as the <i>factory pattern</i> or a <i>simple factory;</i> these are discussed at factory.</p>
<p>The essence of this pattern is to "Define an interface for creating an object, but let the classes that implement the interface decide which class to instantiate. The Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses."</p>
<p>Creating an object often requires complex processes not appropriate to include within a composing object. The object's creation may lead to a significant duplication of code, may require information not accessible to the composing object, may not provide a sufficient level of abstraction, or may otherwise not be part of the composing object's concerns. The factory method design pattern handles these problems by defining a separate method for creating the objects, which subclasses can then override to specify the derived type of product that will be created.</p>
<p>The factory method pattern relies on inheritance, as object creation is delegated to subclasses that implement the factory method to create objects.</p>
<h2>Example implementations</h2>
<h3>Java</h3>
<p>A maze game may be played in two modes, one with regular rooms that are only connected with adjacent rooms, and one with magic rooms that allow players to be transported at random (this Java example is similar to one in the book <i>Design Patterns</i>). The regular game mode could use this template method:</p>

<h3>Java</h3>
<p>A maze game may be played in two modes, one with regular rooms that are only connected with adjacent rooms, and one with magic rooms that allow players to be transported at random (this Java example is similar to one in the book <i>Design Patterns</i>). The regular game mode could use this template method:</p>

<pre>
public class MazeGame {
    public MazeGame() {
        Room room1 = makeRoom();
        Room room2 = makeRoom();
        room1.connect(room2);
        this.addRoom(room1);
        this.addRoom(room2);
    }
 
    protected Room makeRoom() {
        return new OrdinaryRoom();
    }
}
</pre>
<p>In the above snippet, the <code>MazeGame</code> constructor is a template method that makes some common logic. It refers to the <code>makeRoom</code> factory method that encapsulates the creation of rooms such that other rooms can be used in a subclass. To implement the other game mode that has magic rooms, it suffices to override the <code>makeRoom</code> method:</p>

    protected Room makeRoom() {
        return new MagicRoom();
    }
}
</pre>
<h3>PHP</h3>
<p>Another example in PHP follows, this time using interface implementations as opposed to subclassing (however the same can be achieved through subclassing). It is important to note that the factory method can also be defined as public and called directly by the client code (in contrast the Java example above).</p>

<p>You can see we have used GetObject in concreteFactory. As a result, you can easily call DoSomething() from it to get the IProduct. You might also write your custom logic after getting the object in the concrete Factory Method. The GetObject is made abstract in the Factory interface.</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>There are three limitations associated with the use of the factory method. The first relates to refactoring existing code; the other two relate to extending a class.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first limitation is that refactoring an existing class to use factories breaks existing clients. For example, if class Complex were a standard class, it might have numerous clients with code like:</li>
</ul>
<p>WHATSON? 6fd408ee-5176-413c-9e08-6bd3b841401a</p>
<pre>
Complex c = new Complex(-1, 0);
</pre>
<ul>
<li>The second limitation is that, since the pattern relies on using a private constructor, the class cannot be extended. Any subclass must invoke the inherited constructor, but this cannot be done if that constructor is private.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The third limitation is that, if the class were to be extended (e.g., by making the constructor protected—this is risky but feasible), the subclass must provide its own re-implementation of all factory methods with exactly the same signatures. For example, if class <code>StrangeComplex</code> extends <code>Complex</code>, then unless <code>StrangeComplex</code> provides its own version of all factory methods, the call
<div dir="ltr" class="mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr">
<div class="java source-java">
<pre>
StrangeComplex.fromPolar(1, pi);
</pre></div>
</div>
will yield an instance of <code>Complex</code> (the superclass) rather than the expected instance of the subclass. The reflection features of some languages can avoid this issue.</li>
</ul>

<p>All three problems could be alleviated by altering the underlying programming language to make factories first-class class members (see also Virtual class).</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<ul>
<li>In ADO.NET, IDbCommand.CreateParameter is an example of the use of factory method to connect parallel class hierarchies.</li>
<li>In Qt, QMainWindow::createPopupMenu is a factory method declared in a framework that can be overridden in application code.</li>
<li>In Java, several factories are used in the javax.xml.parsers package. e.g. javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory or javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory.</li>
