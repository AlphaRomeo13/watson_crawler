<h1>Working With a Server-Side Application </h1>
<p>Java applets, like other Java programs, can use the API defined in the <code>java.net</code> package to communicate across the network. A Java applet can communicate with server applications that run on the same host as the applet. This communication does not require any special setup on the server.</p>
<p>When the applet is deployed to a web server, use the <code>Applet</code> <code>getCodeBase</code> method and the <code>java.net.URL</code> <code>getHost</code> method to determine which host the applet came from, as follows:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 94b94891-a489-4d73-9d1c-0911062b9f57</p>
<pre>
String host = getCodeBase().getHost();
</pre>
<p>If the applet is deployed locally, the <code>getCodeBase</code> method returns null. Use of a web server is recommended.</p>
<p>After you have the correct host name, you can use all the networking code that is documented in the 
Custom Networking trail.</p>
<p>For an example of implementing an applet that is a network client, see 
Network Client Applet Example.</p>
