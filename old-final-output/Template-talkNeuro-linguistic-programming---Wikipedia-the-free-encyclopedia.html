<h1>Template talk:Neuro-linguistic programming</h1>
<h2>Edits I made</h2>
<p>We really need to keep this template limited to NLP specific articles or articles that directly related to NLP. We cannot link things like "Education" because that article was not written with NLP in mind. It's just not directly related enough. --<i>Woohookitty</i> 09:15, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<h2>Noam Chomsky</h2>
<p>There is zero evidence that Noam Chomsky has had anything to do with NLP, whether as an influence or otherwise. That is bordering on defamation. I removed the link to his name, per WP:BLP violations. Bearian (talk) 21:14, 2 December 2010 (UTC)</p>
<h2>Sidebar?</h2>
<p>This might be better as a side-bar-with-collapsible lists like Template:Feminism sidebar William M. Connolley (talk) 20:19, 5 February 2011 (UTC)</p>
