<h2>Exercises</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Write a class whose instances represent a single playing card from a deck of cards. Playing cards have two distinguishing properties: rank and suit. Be sure to keep your solution as you will be asked to rewrite it in Enum Types.</p>
<div class="note"><hr><strong>Hint:</strong>Â <p>You can use the <code>assert</code> statement to check your assignments. You write:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><pre>
assert (boolean expression to test); 
</pre></div>
<p>If the boolean expression is false, you will get an error message. For example,</p>
<div class="codeblock"><pre>
assert toString(ACE) == "Ace";
</pre></div>
<p>should return <code>true</code>, so there will be no error message.</p>
<p>If you use the <code>assert</code> statement, you must run your program with the <code>ea</code> flag:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><pre>
java -ea YourProgram.class
</pre></div>
<hr></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write a class whose instances represent a <b>full</b> deck of cards. You should also keep this solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3. Write a small program to test your deck and card classes. The program can be as simple as creating a deck of cards and displaying its cards.</p>
