<h1>Import Methods</h1>
<p>Now we will look at the methods used for importing data into a component. These methods are invoked for the drop gesture, or the paste action, when the component is the target of the operation. The <code>TransferHandler</code> methods for importing data are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<code>canImport(TransferHandler.TransferSupport)</code> — This method is called repeatedly during a drag gesture and returns true if the area below the cursor can accept the transfer, or false if the transfer will be rejected. For example, if a user drags a color over a component that accepts only text, the <code>canImport</code> method for that component's <code>TransferHandler</code> should return false.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>importData(TransferHandler.TransferSupport)</code> — This method is called on a successful drop (or paste) and initiates the transfer of data to the target component. This method returns true if the import was successful and false otherwise.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<code>canImport(TransferHandler.TransferSupport)</code> — This method is called repeatedly during a drag gesture and returns true if the area below the cursor can accept the transfer, or false if the transfer will be rejected. For example, if a user drags a color over a component that accepts only text, the <code>canImport</code> method for that component's <code>TransferHandler</code> should return false.</p>
<p>
<code>importData(TransferHandler.TransferSupport)</code> — This method is called on a successful drop (or paste) and initiates the transfer of data to the target component. This method returns true if the import was successful and false otherwise.</p>
<p>These methods replace older versions that do not use the <code>TransferSupport</code> class. Unlike its replacement method, <code>canImport(JComponent, DataFlavor[])</code> is not called continuously.</p>
<p>You will notice that these import methods take a <code>TransferHandler.TransferSupport</code> argument. Next we look at the <code>TransferSupport</code> class and then some sample import methods.</p>
