<h1>European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming</h1>
<p>The <b>European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming</b>, commonly known as <b>ECOOP</b>, is an annual conference covering topics on object-oriented programming systems, languages and applications. Like other conferences, ECOOP offers various tracks and many simultaneous sessions, and thus has different meaning to different people.</p>
<p>The first ECOOP was held in Paris, France in 1986. It operates under the auspices of the <i>Association Internationale pour les Technologies Objets</i> (AITO), a non-profit organization located in Germany.</p>
<p>ECOOPâ€™s venue changes every year, and the categories of its program vary. Historically ECOOP has combined the presentation of academic papers with comparatively practical experience reports, panels, workshops and tutorials.</p>
<p>ECOOP helped object-oriented programming develop in Europe into what is now mainstream programming, and helped incubate a number of related disciplines, including design patterns, refactoring, aspect-oriented programming, Model Driven Engineering, and agile software development.</p>
<p>The winners of the annual AITO Dahl-Nygaard Prize are offered the opportunity to give a keynote presentation at ECOOP.</p>
<p>The sister conference of ECOOP in North America is OOPSLA.</p>
