<h1>About the Java Technology</h1>
<p>Java technology is both a programming language and a platform.</p>
<h2>The Java Programming Language</h2>
<p>The Java programming language is a high-level language that can be characterized by all of the following buzzwords:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Object oriented</li>
<li>Distributed</li>
<li>Multithreaded</li>
<li>Dynamic</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Architecture neutral</li>
<li>Portable</li>
<li>High performance</li>
<li>Robust</li>
<li>Secure</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the preceding buzzwords is explained in 
<em>The Java Language Environment</em> , a white paper written by James Gosling and Henry McGilton.</p>
<p>In the Java programming language, all source code is first written in plain text files ending with the <code>.java</code> extension. Those source files are then compiled into <code>.class</code> files by the <code>javac</code> compiler. A <code>.class</code> file does not contain code that is native to your processor; it instead contains <em>bytecodes</em> — the machine language of the Java Virtual Machine (Java VM). The <code>java</code> launcher tool then runs your application with an instance of the Java Virtual Machine.</p>
<p>An overview of the software development process.</p>
<p>Because the Java VM is available on many different operating systems, the same <code>.class</code> files are capable of running on Microsoft Windows, the Solaris™ Operating System (Solaris OS), Linux, or Mac OS. Some virtual machines, such as the 
Java SE HotSpot at a Glance, perform additional steps at runtime to give your application a performance boost. This include various tasks such as finding performance bottlenecks and recompiling (to native code) frequently used sections of code.</p>
<p>Through the Java VM, the same application is capable of running on multiple platforms.</p>
<h2>The Java Platform</h2>
<p>A <em>platform</em> is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs. We've already mentioned some of the most popular platforms like Microsoft Windows, Linux, Solaris OS, and Mac OS. Most platforms can be described as a combination of the operating system and underlying hardware. The Java platform differs from most other platforms in that it's a software-only platform that runs on top of other hardware-based platforms.</p>
<p>The Java platform has two components:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Java Virtual Machine</em></li>
<li>The <em>Java Application Programming Interface</em> (API)</li>
</ul>
<p>You've already been introduced to the Java Virtual Machine; it's the base for the Java platform and is ported onto various hardware-based platforms.</p>
<p>The API is a large collection of ready-made software components that provide many useful capabilities. It is grouped into libraries of related classes and interfaces; these libraries are known as <em>packages</em>. The next section, 
What Can Java Technology Do? highlights some of the functionality provided by the API.</p>
<p>The API and Java Virtual Machine insulate the program from the underlying hardware.</p>
<p>As a platform-independent environment, the Java platform can be a bit slower than native code. However, advances in compiler and virtual machine technologies are bringing performance close to that of native code without threatening portability.</p>
<p>The terms"Java Virtual Machine" and "JVM" mean a Virtual Machine for the Java platform.</p>
