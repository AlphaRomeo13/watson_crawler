<h4>Allowing applications to play nice(r) with each other: Handling remote control
buttons</h4>
<p>If your media playback application creates a media playback service, just like Music, that
responds to the media button events, how will the user know where those events are going to? Music,
or your new application?</p>
<h4>Making Android Games that Play Nice</h4>
<p>Making a game on Android is easy. Making a great game for a mobile, multitasking, often
multi-core, multi-purpose system like Android is trickier. Even the best developers frequently make
mistakes in the way they interact with the Android system and with other applications</p>
<h4>More Android Games that Play Nice</h4>
<p>Android users get used to using the back key. We expect the volume keys to work in some
intuitive fashion. We expect that the home key behaves in a manner consistent with the Android
navigation paradigm.</p>
<h3>Training</h3>
<h4>Capturing Photos</h4>
<p>This class gets you clicking fast with some super-easy ways of leveraging existing camera
applications. In later lessons, you dive deeper and learn how to control the camera hardware
directly.</p>
<h4>Managing Audio Playback</h4>
<p>After this class, you will be able to build apps that respond to hardware audio key
presses, which request audio focus when playing audio, and which respond appropriately to changes in
audio focus caused by the system or other applications.</p>
