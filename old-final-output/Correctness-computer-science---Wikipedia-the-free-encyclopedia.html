<h1>Correctness (computer science)</h1>
<p>In theoretical computer science, <b>correctness</b> of an algorithm is asserted when it is said that the algorithm is correct with respect to a specification. <i>Functional</i> correctness refers to the input-output behaviour of the algorithm (i.e., for each input it produces the correct output).</p>
<p>A distinction is made between <b>total correctness</b>, which additionally requires that the algorithm terminates, and <b>partial correctness</b>, which simply requires that <i>if</i> an answer is returned it will be correct. Since there is no general solution to the halting problem, a total correctness assertion may lie much deeper. A termination proof is a type of mathematical proof that plays a critical role in formal verification because total correctness of an algorithm depends on termination.</p>
<p>For example, successively searching through integers 1, 2, 3, … to see if we can find an example of some phenomenon — say an odd perfect number — it is quite easy to write a partially correct program (using long division by two to check <i>n</i> as perfect or not). But to say this program is totally correct would be to assert something currently not known in number theory.</p>
<p>A proof would have to be a mathematical proof, assuming both the algorithm and specification are given formally. In particular it is not expected to be a correctness assertion for a given program implementing the algorithm on a given machine. That would involve such considerations as limitations on computer memory.</p>
<p>A deep result in proof theory, the Curry-Howard correspondence, states that a proof of functional correctness in constructive logic corresponds to a certain program in the lambda calculus. Converting a proof in this way is called <i>program extraction</i>.</p>
<p>Hoare logic is a specific formal system for reasoning rigorously about the correctness of computer programs.</p>
