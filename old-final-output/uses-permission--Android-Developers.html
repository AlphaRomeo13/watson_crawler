<h1>&lt;uses-permission&gt;</h1>
<p>Google Play Filtering</p>
<p>In some cases, the permissions that you request
through <code>&lt;uses-permission&gt;</code> can affect how
your application is filtered by Google Play.</p>
<p>If you request a hardware-related permission —
<code>CAMERA</code>, for example — Google Play assumes that your
application requires the underlying hardware feature and filters the application
from devices that do not offer it.</p>
<p>To control filtering, always explicitly declare
hardware features in <code>&lt;uses-feature&gt;</code> elements, rather than
relying on Google Play to "discover" the requirements in
<code>&lt;uses-permission&gt;</code> elements. Then, if you want to disable
filtering for a particular feature, you can add a
<code>android:required="false"</code> attribute to the
<code>&lt;uses-feature&gt;</code> declaration.</p>
<p>For a list of permissions that imply
hardware features, see the documentation for the 
<code>&lt;uses-feature&gt;</code> element.</p>

<pre>&lt;uses-permission android:name="<i>string</i>"
        android:maxSdkVersion="<i>integer</i>" /&gt;</pre>
<p>
For more information on permissions, see the 
Permissions 
section in the introduction and the separate 
Security and Permissions document.  
A list of permissions defined by the base platform can be found at 
<code>android.Manifest.permission</code>.

</p>
<p>For example, beginning with Android 4.4 (API level 19), it's no longer necessary for your app
to request the <code>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> permission when your
app wants to write to its own application-specific directories on external storage (the directories
provided by <code>getExternalFilesDir()</code>). However,
the permission <em>is required</em> for API level 18 and lower. So you can declare that this
permission is needed only up to API level 18 with a declaration such as this:
</p>
<p>WHATSON? 64bcc867-6b0b-4ed7-a390-4cf5ea4fbc8d</p>
<pre>
&lt;uses-permission
     android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"
     android:maxSdkVersion="18" /&gt;
</pre>
<p>This way, beginning with API level 19, the system will no longer grant your app the
<code>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> permission.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>&lt;permission&gt;</code></li>
  <li><code>&lt;uses-feature&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
