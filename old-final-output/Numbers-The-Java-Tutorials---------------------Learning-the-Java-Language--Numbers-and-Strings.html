<h1>Numbers</h1>
<p>This section begins with a discussion of the 
<code>Number</code> class in the <code>java.lang</code> package, its subclasses, and the situations where you would use instantiations of these classes rather than the primitive number types.</p>
<p>This section also presents the 
<code>PrintStream</code> and 
<code>DecimalFormat</code> classes, which provide methods for writing formatted numerical output.</p>
<p>Finally, the 
<code>Math</code> class in <code>java.lang</code> is discussed. It contains mathematical functions to complement the operators built into the language. This class has methods for the trigonometric functions, exponential functions, and so forth.</p>
