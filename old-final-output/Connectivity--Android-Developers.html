<h3>Blog Articles</h3>
<h4>Android’s HTTP Clients</h4>
<p>Most network-connected Android apps will use HTTP to send and receive data. Android
includes two HTTP clients: HttpURLConnection and Apache HTTP Client. Both support HTTPS, streaming
uploads and downloads, configurable timeouts, IPv6 and connection pooling.</p>
<h3>Training</h3>
<h4>Transferring Data Without Draining the Battery</h4>
<p>This class demonstrates the best practices for scheduling and executing downloads using
techniques such as caching, polling, and prefetching. You will learn how the power-use profile of
the wireless radio can affect your choices on when, what, and how to transfer data in order to
minimize impact on battery life.</p>
<h4>Syncing to the Cloud</h4>
<p>This class covers different strategies for cloud enabled applications. It covers syncing
data with the cloud using your own back-end web application, and backing up data using the cloud so
that users can restore their data when installing your application on a new device.</p>
