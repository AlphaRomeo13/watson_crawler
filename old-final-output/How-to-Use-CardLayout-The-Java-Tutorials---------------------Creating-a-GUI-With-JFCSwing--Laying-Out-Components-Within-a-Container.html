<h1>How to Use CardLayout</h1>
<p>If you are interested in using JavaFX to create your GUI, see
Working With Layouts in JavaFX.</p>
<p>The following figure represents a snapshot of an application that uses the 
<code>CardLayout</code> class to switch between two panels.</p>

<p>Click the Launch button to run CardLayoutDemo using 
Java™ Web Start (download Java SE). Alternatively, to compile and run the example yourself, consult the example index.</p>
<p>The complete code of this demo is in the 
<code>CardLayoutDemo.java</code> file.</p>
<p>The <code>CardLayout</code> class manages two or more components (usually <code>JPanel</code> instances) that share the same display space. When using the <code>CardLayout</code> class, let the user choose between the components by using a combo box. The <code>CardLayoutDemo</code> application is an example to illustrate this feature.</p>
<p>Another way to accomplish the same task is to use a 
tabbed pane. The following picture shows a tabbed pane version of the preceding example: 
</p>
<p>Because a tabbed pane provides its own GUI, using a tabbed pane is simpler than using the <code>CardLayout</code> class. For example, implementing the preceding example using a tabbed pane results in a program with fewer lines of code.</p>
<p>Click the Launch button to run TabDemo using 
Java™ Web Start (download JDK 7 or later). Alternatively, to compile and run the example yourself, consult the example index.</p>
<p>The complete code of this demo is in the 
<code>TabDemo.java</code> file.</p>
<p>Conceptually, each component that a <code>CardLayout</code> manages is like a playing card or trading card in a stack, where only the top card is visible at any time. You can choose the card that is showing in any of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>By asking for either the first or last card, in the order it was added to the container</li>
<li>By flipping through the deck backwards or forwards</li>
<li>By specifying a card with a specific name</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>CardLayoutDemo</code> class uses the last scheme.</p>
<p>The following code snippet from the 
<code>CardLayoutDemo.java</code> application creates the <code>CardLayout</code> object and the components it manages.</p>
<p>WHATSON? 79f6c4fe-c70d-4cf5-83ec-9bea25b28ea3</p>
<pre>
<em>//Where instance variables are declared:</em>
JPanel cards;
final static String BUTTONPANEL = "Card with JButtons";
final static String TEXTPANEL = "Card with JTextField";

<em>//Where the components controlled by the CardLayout are initialized:</em>
//Create the "cards".
JPanel card1 = new JPanel();
...
JPanel card2 = new JPanel();
...

//Create the panel that contains the "cards".
cards = new JPanel(new CardLayout());
cards.add(card1, BUTTONPANEL);
cards.add(card2, TEXTPANEL);
</pre>
<p>To add a component to a container that a <code>CardLayout</code> object manages, specify a string that identifies the component being added. For example, in this demo, the first panel has the string <code>"Card with JButtons"</code>, and the second panel has the string <code>"Card with JTextField"</code>. In this demo those strings are also used in the combo box.</p>
<p>To choose which component a <code>CardLayout</code> object shows, put additional code in your code example:</p>
<p>WHATSON? dc0656c2-01c1-44c3-92df-e78c7770b1dc</p>
<pre>
<em>//Where the GUI is assembled:</em>
//Put the JComboBox in a JPanel to get a nicer look.
JPanel comboBoxPane = new JPanel(); //use FlowLayout
String comboBoxItems[] = { BUTTONPANEL, TEXTPANEL };
JComboBox cb = new JComboBox(comboBoxItems);
cb.setEditable(false);
cb.addItemListener(this);
comboBoxPane.add(cb);
...
pane.add(comboBoxPane, BorderLayout.PAGE_START);
pane.add(cards, BorderLayout.CENTER);
...

//Method came from the ItemListener class implementation,
//contains functionality to process the combo box item selecting
public void itemStateChanged(ItemEvent evt) {
    CardLayout cl = (CardLayout)(cards.getLayout());
    cl.show(cards, (String)evt.getItem());
}
</pre>
<p>This example shows that to use the <code>show</code> method of the <code>CardLayout</code> class, you must set the currently visible component. The first argument in the <code>show</code> method is the container the <code>CardLayout</code> controls  that is, the container of the components the <code>CardLayout</code> manages. The second argument is the string that identifies the component to show. This string is the same string that was used when adding the component to the container.</p>
<h2>The CardLayout API</h2>
<p>The following table lists the <code>CardLayout</code> class methods that are used to choose a component. For each method, the first argument is the container for which the <code>CardLayout</code> is the layout manager (the container of the cards the <code>CardLayout</code> controls).</p>
<h2>Examples that Use CardLayout</h2>
<p>Only one example in this 
trail
uses <code>CardLayout</code>, and this is the <code>CardLayoutDemo</code>. Generally, our examples use 
tabbed panes instead of <code>CardLayout</code>, since a tabbed pane provides its own GUI.</p>
