<h1>Signal programming</h1>
<p><b>Signal programming</b> is used in the same sense as dataflow programming, and is similar to event-driven programming.</p>
<p>The word signal is used instead of the word dataflow in documentation of such libraries as Qt, GTK+ and libsigc++. The time instants when the signal value (or dataflow value) changes correspond to events in event-driven programming.</p>
<p>The signal flow of a program or a signal processing system is described graphically in a signal-flow graph or a data-flow diagram.</p>
<h2>Synchronous signal programming</h2>
<p>In software development, a <i>signal</i> can mean synchronous events (sequences of samples, video frames, etc., with constant sample rate or frame rate) rather than asynchronous events, while the word <i>event</i> and <i>data flow</i> is often used for asynchronous event queues, but this is by no means universal. Especially in telecommunications, electrical engineering and signal processing, a digital signal is a sampled representation of an analog physical entity.</p>
<p>In telecommunications, the term signalling means asynchronous phone call metadata information exchange, for example of telephone numbers.</p>
<p>One application of synchronous signal programming is observer pattern.</p>
<h2>Asynchronous signal programming</h2>
<p>In databases and operational systems, a signal is a sequence or flow of messages within a message passing architecture that a software agent can subscribe on. Note that these signals are asynchronous. Also <b>signal programming</b> is used in a narrow sense of programming with Unix signals such as SIGTERM, SIGSEGV, SIGPOLL etc.</p>
