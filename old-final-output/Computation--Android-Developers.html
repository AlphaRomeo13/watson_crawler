<h4>Evolution of RenderScript Performance</h4>
<p>It’s been a year since the last blog post on RenderScript, and with the release
      of Android 4.2, it’s a good time to talk about the performance work that we’ve done
      since then. One of the major goals of this past year was to improve the performance
      of common image-processing operations with RenderScript.</p>
<h4>Levels in RenderScript</h4>
<p>For ICS, RenderScript (RS) has been updated with several new features to simplify
        adding compute acceleration to your application. RS is interesting for compute
        acceleration when you have large buffers of data on which you need to do significant
        processing. In this example we will look at applying a levels/saturation operation
        on a bitmap.</p>
<h4>RenderScript Part 2</h4>
<p>In Introducing RenderScript I gave a brief overview of this technology.
          In this post I’ll look at "compute" in more detail. In RenderScript we use
          "compute" to mean offloading of data processing from Dalvik code to
          RenderScript code which may run on the same or different processor(s).</p>
