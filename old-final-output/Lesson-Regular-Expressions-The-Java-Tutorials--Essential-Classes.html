<h1>Lesson: Regular Expressions</h1>
<p>This lesson explains how to use the <code>
<code>java.util.regex</code></code> API for pattern matching with regular expressions. Although the syntax accepted by this package is similar to the 
Perl programming language, knowledge of Perl is not a prerequisite. This lesson starts with the basics, and gradually builds to cover more advanced techniques.</p>
