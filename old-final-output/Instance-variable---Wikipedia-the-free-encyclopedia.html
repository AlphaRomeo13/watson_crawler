<h1>Instance variable</h1>
<p>In object-oriented programming with classes, an <b>instance variable</b> is a variable defined in a class (i.e. a member variable), for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance. An instance variable is similar to and contrasts with a class variable.</p>
<p>An instance variable is not a Class variable. It is a type of class attribute (or class property, field, or data member). The same dichotomy between <i>instance</i> and <i>class</i> members applies to methods ("member functions") as well; a class may have both instance methods and class methods.</p>
<p>Each class variable and instance variable you invoke with the object lives in memory for the life of that object.</p>
<p>Instance variables are properties an object knows about itself. All instances of an object have their own copies of instance variables, even if the value is the same from one object to another. One object instance can change values of its instance variables without affecting all other instances. Instance variables can be used by all methods of a class unless the method is declared as static.</p>

<p>WHATSON? 8c5e0add-e9fe-4a83-99d6-703f6f340e19</p>
<pre>
struct Request {
 
    static int count;
    int number;
 
    Request() {
        number = count; // modifies the instance variable "this-&gt;number"
        ++count; // modifies the class variable "Request::count"
    }
 
};
 
int Request::count = 0;
</pre>
<p>In this C++ example, the instance variable <code>Request::number</code> is a copy of the class variable <code>Request::count</code> where each instance constructed is assigned a sequential value of <code>count</code> before it is incremented. Since <code>number</code> is an instance variable, each Request object contains its own distinct value; in contrast, there is only one object <code>Request::count</code> available to all instances with the same value.</p>
