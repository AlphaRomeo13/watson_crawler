<h1>Arrow (computer science)</h1>
<p>In computer science, <b>arrows</b> are a type class used in programming to describe computations in a pure and declarative fashion. First proposed by computer scientist John Hughes as a generalization of monads, arrows provide a referentially transparent way of expressing relationships between <i>logical</i> steps in a computation. Unlike monads, arrows don't limit steps to having one and only one input. As a result, they have found use in functional reactive programming, point-free programming, and parsers among other applications.</p>

<h2>Motivation and History</h2>
<p>While arrows were in use before being recognized as a distinct class, Hughes would publish their first definition in 2000. Until then, monads had proven sufficient for most problems requiring the combination of program logic in pure code. However, some useful libraries, such as the Fudgets library for graphical user interfaces and certain efficient parsers, defied rewriting in a monadic form.</p>
<p>The formal concept of arrows was developed to explain these exceptions to monadic code, and in the process, monads themselves turned out to be a subset of arrows. Since then, arrows have been an active area of research. Their underlying laws and operations have been refined several times, with recent formulations such as arrow calculus requiring only five laws.</p>
<p>In category theory, the Kleisli categories of all monads form a proper subset of Hughes arrows. While Freyd categories were believed to be equivalent to arrows for a time, it has since been proven that arrows are even more general. In fact, arrows are not merely equivalent, but directly equal to enriched Freyd categories.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>Like all type classes, arrows can be thought of as a set of qualities that can be applied to any data type. In the Haskell programming language, arrows allow functions (represented in Haskell by an arrow symbol) to combine in a reified form. However, the actual term "arrow" may also come from the fact that some (but not all) arrows correspond to the morphisms (also known as "arrows" in category theory) of different Kleisli categories. As a relatively new concept, there is not a single, standard definition, but all formulations are logically equivalent, feature some required methods, and strictly obey certain mathematical laws.</p>
<h3>Functions</h3>
<p>The description currently used by the Haskell standard libraries <i>requires</i> only two basic operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>A type constructor <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="arr" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/7/c/47c80780ab608cc046f2a6e6f071feb6.png"> that takes functions <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="\to" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/a/5/da558173e1f2ddfeb273751d481f9a52.png"> from any type <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="s" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/3/c/03c7c0ace395d80182db07ae2c30f034.png"> to another <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="t" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/3/5/e358efa489f58062f10dd7316b65649e.png">, and lifts those functions into an arrow <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="A" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/f/c/7fc56270e7a70fa81a5935b72eacbe29.png"> between the two types.</li>

This in turn can theoretically lead to better compiler optimizations, easier debugging, and features like syntax sugar.</p>
<p>Although no program strictly requires arrows, they generalize away much of the dense function passing that pure, declarative code would otherwise require. They can also encourage code reuse by giving common linkages between program steps their own class definitions. The ability to apply to types generically also contributes to reusability and keeps interfaces simple.</p>
<p>Arrows do have some disadvantages, including the initial effort of defining an arrow that satisfies the arrow laws. Because monads are usually easier to implement, and the extra features of arrows may be unnecessary, it is often preferable to use a monad. Another issue, which applies to many functional programming constructs, is efficiently compiling code with arrows into the imperative style used by computer instruction sets.</p>
