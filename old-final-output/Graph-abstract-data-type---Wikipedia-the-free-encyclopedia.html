<h1>Graph (abstract data type)</h1>
<p>In computer science, a <b>graph</b> is an abstract data type that is meant to implement the graph and directed graph concepts from mathematics.</p>
<p>A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of <b>nodes</b> or <b>vertices</b>, together with a set of ordered pairs of these nodes (or, in some cases, a set of unordered pairs). These pairs are known as <b>edges</b> or <b>arcs</b>. As in mathematics, an edge (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) is said to <b>point</b> or <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <i>x</i> <b>to</b> <i>y</i>. The nodes may be part of the graph structure, or may be external entities represented by integer indices or references.</p>
<p>A graph data structure may also associate to each edge some <b>edge value</b>, such as a symbolic label or a numeric attribute (cost, capacity, length, etc.).</p>

<h2>Algorithms</h2>
<p>Graph algorithms are a significant field of interest within computer science. Typical higher-level operations associated with graphs are: finding a path between two nodes, like depth-first search and breadth-first search and finding the shortest path from one node to another, like Dijkstra's algorithm. A solution to finding the shortest path from each node to every other node also exists in the form of the Floyd–Warshall algorithm.</p>
<h2>Operations</h2>
<p>The basic operations provided by a graph data structure <i>G</i> usually include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>adjacent</code>(<i>G</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>): tests whether there is an edge from node <i>x</i> to node <i>y</i>.</li>
<li><code>neighbors</code>(<i>G</i>, <i>x</i>): lists all nodes <i>y</i> such that there is an edge from <i>x</i> to <i>y</i>.</li>
<li><code>add</code>(<i>G</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>): adds to <i>G</i> the edge from <i>x</i> to <i>y</i>, if it is not there.</li>
<li><code>delete</code>(<i>G</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>): removes the edge from <i>x</i> to <i>y</i>, if it is there.</li>
<li><code>get_node_value</code>(<i>G</i>, <i>x</i>): returns the value associated with the node <i>x</i>.</li>
<li><code>set_node_value</code>(<i>G</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>a</i>): sets the value associated with the node <i>x</i> to <i>a</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Structures that associate values to the edges usually also provide:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>get_edge_value</code>(<i>G</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>): returns the value associated to the edge (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>).</li>
<li><code>set_edge_value</code>(<i>G</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>v</i>): sets the value associated to the edge (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) to <i>v</i>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Representations</h2>
<p>Different data structures for the representation of graphs are used in practice:</p>
<p>The following table gives the time complexity cost of performing various operations on graphs, for each of these representations. In the matrix representations, the entries encode the cost of following an edge. The cost of edges that are not present are assumed to be <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt=" \infty " src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/2/4/d245777abca64ece2d5d7ca0d19fddb6.png">.</p>
<p>Adjacency lists are generally preferred because they efficiently represent sparse graphs. An adjacency matrix is preferred if the graph is dense, that is the number of edges |<i>E</i>| is close to the number of vertices squared, |<i>V</i>|, or if one must be able to quickly look up if there is an edge connecting two vertices.</p>
