<h1>Guidelines for Wildcard Use</h1>
<p>
One of the more confusing aspects when learning to program with generics is determining when to use an upper bounded wildcard and when to use a lower bounded wildcard. This page provides some guidelines to follow when designing your code.</p>
<p>
For purposes of this discussion, it is helpful to think of variables as providing one of two functions:</p>
<p>
Of course, some variables are used both for "in" and "out" purposes â€” this scenario is also addressed in the guidelines.</p>
<p>
You can use the "in" and "out" principle when deciding whether to use a wildcard and what type of wildcard is appropriate. The following list provides the guidelines to follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>An "in" variable is defined with an upper bounded wildcard, using the <tt>extends</tt> keyword.</li>
<li>An "out" variable is defined with a lower bounded wildcard, using the <tt>super</tt> keyword.</li>
<li>In the case where the "in" variable can be accessed using methods defined in the <tt>Object</tt> class, use an unbounded wildcard.</li>
<li>In the case where the code needs to access the variable as both an "in" and an "out" variable, do not use a wildcard.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These guidelines do not apply to a method's return type. Using a wildcard as a return type should be avoided because it forces programmers using the code to deal with wildcards.</p>
<p>
A list defined by <tt>List&lt;? extends ...&gt;</tt> can be informally thought of as read-only, but that is not a strict guarantee.  Suppose you have the following two classes:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 687bef13-022e-4e5e-8dcc-380315e96965</p>
<pre>
class NaturalNumber {

    private int i;

    public NaturalNumber(int i) { this.i = i; }
    // ...
}

class EvenNumber extends NaturalNumber {

    public EvenNumber(int i) { super(i); }
    // ...
}
</pre>
<p>
Consider the following code:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 2bc72d3e-6526-465c-87d2-b2cb6cbbab0b</p>
<pre>
List&lt;EvenNumber&gt; le = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
List&lt;? extends NaturalNumber&gt; ln = le;
ln.add(new NaturalNumber(35));  // compile-time error
</pre>
<p>
Because <tt>List&lt;EvenNumber&gt;</tt> is a subtype of <tt>List&lt;? extends NaturalNumber&gt;</tt>, you can assign <tt>le</tt> to <tt>ln</tt>. But you cannot use <tt>ln</tt> to add a natural number to a list of even numbers. The following operations on the list are possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can add <tt>null</tt>.</li>
<li>You can invoke <tt>clear</tt>.</li>
<li>You can get the iterator and invoke <tt>remove</tt>.</li>
<li>You can capture the wildcard and write elements that you've read from the list.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can see that the list defined by <tt>List&lt;? extends NaturalNumber&gt;</tt> is not read-only in the strictest sense of the word, but you might think of it that way because you cannot store a new element or change an existing element in the list.</p>
