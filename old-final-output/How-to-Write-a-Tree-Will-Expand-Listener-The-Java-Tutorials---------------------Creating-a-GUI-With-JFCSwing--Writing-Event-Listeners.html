<h1>How to Write a Tree-Will-Expand Listener</h1>
<p>The <em>tree-will-expand</em> listener prevents a 
tree node from expanding or collapsing. To be notified just <em>after</em> an expansion or collapse occurs, you should use a <em>tree expansion listener</em> instead.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This demo adds a tree-will-expand listener to the <code>TreeExpandEventDemo</code> example discussed in How to Write a Tree Expansion Listener. The code added here demonstrates that <em>tree-will-expand</em> listeners prevent node expansions and collapses: The listener will prompt you for confirmation each time you try to expand a node.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the Launch button to run TreeExpandEventDemo2 using 
Java™ Web Start (download JDK 7 or later). Alternatively, to compile and run the example yourself, consult the example index.<img src="../../images/jws-launch-button.png" width="88" height="23" align="bottom" alt="Launches the TreeExpandEventDemo2 example"><br></li>
<li>Click the graphic to the left of the <b>Potrero Hill</b> node. This tells the tree that you want to expand the node.<br>
A dialog appears asking you whether you really want to expand the node.</li>
<li>Click "Expand" or dismiss the dialog.<br>
Messages in the text area tell you that both a tree-will-expand event and a tree-expanded event have occurred. At the end of each message is the path to the expanded node.</li>
<li>Try to expand another node, but this time press the "Cancel Expansion" button in the dialog.<br>
The node does not expand. Messages in the text area tell you that a tree-will-expand event occurred, and that you cancelled a tree expansion.</li>
<li>Collapse the <b>Potrero Hill</b> node.<br>
The node collapses without a dialog appearing, because the event handler's <code>treeWillCollapse</code> method lets the collapse occur, uncontested.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following snippet shows the code that this program adds to <code>TreeExpandEventDemo</code>. The bold line prevents the tree expansion from happening. You can find all the demo's source code in 
<code>TreeExpandEventDemo2.java</code>.</p>
