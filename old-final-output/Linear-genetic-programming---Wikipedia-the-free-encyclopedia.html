<h1>Linear genetic programming</h1>
<p><b>Linear Genetic Programming</b> (LGP) is a particular subset of genetic programming wherein computer programs in population are represented as a sequence of instructions from imperative programming language or machine language. The graph-based data flow that results from a multiple usage of register contents and the existence of structurally noneffective code (introns) are two main differences to more common tree-based genetic programming (TGP) variant. </p>

<h2>Examples of LGP programs</h2>
<p>Because LGP programs are basically represented by a linear sequence of instructions, they are simpler to read and to operate on than their tree-based counterparts. For example, a simple program written in the LGP language Slash/A looks like a series of instructions separated by a slash:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 900de641-751c-4772-8339-a85390730ef4</p>
<pre>
input/   # gets an input from user and saves it to register F
0/       # sets register I = 0
save/    # saves content of F into data vector D[I] (i.e. D[0] := F)
input/   # gets another input, saves to F
add/     # adds to F current data pointed to by I (i.e. F := F + D[0])
output/. # outputs result from F
</pre>
<p>By representing such code in bytecode format, i.e. as an array of bytes each representing a different instruction, one can make mutation operations simply by changing an element of such an array.</p>
