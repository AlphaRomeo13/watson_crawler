<h1>Skeleton (computer programming)</h1>
<p><b>Skeleton programming</b> is a style of computer programming based on simple high-level program structures and so called <b>dummy code</b>. Program skeletons resemble pseudocode, but allow parsing, compilation and testing of the code.</p>
<p>Dummy code is inserted in a program skeleton to simulate processing and avoid compilation error messages. It may involve empty function declarations, or functions that return a correct result only for a simple test case where the expected response of the code is known.</p>
<p>Skeleton programming facilitates a top-down design approach, where a partially functional system with complete high-level structures is designed and coded, and this system is then progressively expanded to fulfill the requirements of the project.</p>
<p>Program skeletons are sometimes used for high-level descriptions of algorithms.</p>
<p>A program skeleton may also be utilized as a template that reflects syntax and structures commonly used in a wide class of problems.</p>
<p>Skeleton programs are utilized in the template method design pattern used in object-oriented programming. See that article for examples of skeleton programs.</p>
<p>In object-oriented programming, dummy code corresponds to an abstract method, a method stub or a mock object. In RMI nomenclature, a skeleton communicates on the client-side with a stub on the server-side.</p>
