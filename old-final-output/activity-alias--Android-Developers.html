<p>
The alias presents the target activity as a independent entity.
It can have its own set of intent filters, and they, rather than the 
intent filters on the target activity itself, determine which intents 
can activate the target through the alias and how the system
treats the alias.  For example, the intent filters on the alias may 
specify the "<code><code>android.intent.action.MAIN</code></code>" 
and "<code><code>android.intent.category.LAUNCHER</code></code>" flags, causing it to be 
represented in the application launcher, even though none of the 
filters on the target activity itself set these flags.
</p>
<p>
With the exception of <code>targetActivity</code>, <code>&lt;activity-alias&gt;</code> 
attributes are a subset of <code>&lt;activity&gt;</code> attributes.  
For attributes in the subset, none of the values set for the target carry over
to the alias.  However, for attributes not in the subset, the values set for 
the target activity also apply to the alias.
</p>
<p>
The <code>&lt;application&gt;</code> element has its own 
<code>enabled</code> attribute that applies to all 
application components, including activity aliases.  The 
<code>&lt;application&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;activity-alias&gt;</code> 
attributes must both be "<code>true</code>" for the system to be able to instantiate 
the target activity through the alias.  If either is "<code>false</code>", the alias 
does not work.
</p>
<p>
The default value depends on whether the alias contains intent filters.  The 
absence of any filters means that the activity can be invoked through the alias
only by specifying the exact name of the alias.  This implies that the alias 
is intended only for application-internal use (since others would not know its name)  
— so the default value is "<code>false</code>".
On the other hand, the presence of at least one filter implies that the alias 
is intended for external use — so the default value is "<code>true</code>".
</p>
<p>This attribute supplants any permission set for the target activity itself.  If
it is not set, a permission is not needed to activate the target through the alias.
</p>

Permissions 
section in the introduction.
