<h1>Quadratically constrained quadratic program</h1>
<p>In mathematical optimization, a <b>quadratically constrained quadratic program</b> (<b>QCQP</b>) is an optimization problem in which both the objective function and the constraints are quadratic functions. It has the form</p>
<p>where <i>P</i><sub>0</sub>, … <i>P</i><sub><i>m</i></sub> are <i>n</i>-by-<i>n</i> matrices and <i>x</i> ∈ <b>R</b> is the optimization variable.</p>
<p>If <i>P</i><sub>0</sub>, … <i>P</i><sub><i>m</i></sub> are all positive semidefinite, then the problem is convex. If these matrices are neither positive or negative semidefinite, the problem is non-convex. If <i>P</i><sub>1</sub>, … <i>P</i><sub><i>m</i></sub> are all zero, then the constraints are in fact linear and the problem is a quadratic program.</p>

<h2>Hardness</h2>
<p>Solving the general case is an NP-hard problem. To see this, note that the two constraints <i>x</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>x</i><sub>1</sub> − 1) ≤ 0 and <i>x</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>x</i><sub>1</sub> − 1) ≥ 0 are equivalent to the constraint <i>x</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>x</i><sub>1</sub> − 1) = 0, which is in turn equivalent to the constraint <i>x</i><sub>1</sub> ∈ {0, 1}. Hence, any 0–1 integer program (in which all variables have to be either 0 or 1) can be formulated as a quadratically constrained quadratic program. Since 0–1 integer programming is NP-hard in general, QCQP is also NP-hard.</p>
<h2>Relaxation</h2>
<p>There are two main relaxations of QCQP: using semidefinite programming (SDP), and using the reformulation-linearization technique (RLT).</p>
<h3>Semidefinite programming</h3>
<p>When <i>P</i><sub>0</sub>, … <i>P</i><sub><i>m</i></sub> are all positive-definite matrices, the problem is convex and can be readily solved using interior point methods, as done with semidefinite programming.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Max Cut is a problem in graph theory, which is NP-hard. Given a graph, the problem is to divide the vertices in two sets, so that as many edges as possible go from one set to the other. Max Cut can be formulated as a QCQP, and SDP relaxation of the dual provides good lower bounds.</p>
