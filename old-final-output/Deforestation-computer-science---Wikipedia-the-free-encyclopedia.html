<h1>Deforestation (computer science)</h1>
<p>In the theory of programming languages in computer science, <b>deforestation</b> (also known as <b>fusion</b>) is a program transformation to eliminate tree structures.</p>
<p>The term "deforestation" was originally coined by Philip Wadler in his paper "Deforestation: transforming programs to eliminate trees".</p>
<p>Deforestation is typically applied to programs in functional programming languages, particularly non-strict programming languages such as Haskell. One particular algorithm for deforestation, <i>shortcut deforestation</i>, is implemented in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.</p>
