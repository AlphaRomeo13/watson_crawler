<h1>Near Field Communication</h1>
<p>Near Field Communication (NFC) is a set of short-range wireless technologies, typically
  requiring a distance of 4cm or less to initiate a connection. NFC allows you to share small
  payloads of data between an NFC tag and an Android-powered device, or between two Android-powered
  devices.

  </p>
<p>Tags can range in complexity. Simple tags offer just read and write semantics, sometimes with
  one-time-programmable areas to make the card read-only. More complex tags offer math operations,
  and have cryptographic hardware to authenticate access to a sector. The most sophisticated tags
  contain operating environments, allowing complex interactions with code executing on the tag.
  The data stored in the tag can also be written in a variety of formats, but many of the Android
  framework APIs are based around a NFC Forum standard
  called NDEF (NFC Data Exchange Format).</p>
<p>Android-powered devices with NFC simultaneously support three main modes of operation:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reader/writer mode</strong>, allowing the NFC device to read and/or write 
passive NFC tags and stickers.</li>
<li><strong>P2P mode</strong>, allowing the NFC device to exchange data with other NFC 
peers; this operation mode is used by Android Beam.</li>
<li><strong>Card emulation mode</strong>, allowing the NFC device itself to act as an NFC 
card. The emulated NFC card can then be accessed by an external NFC reader, 
such as an NFC point-of-sale terminal.</li>
</ol>
