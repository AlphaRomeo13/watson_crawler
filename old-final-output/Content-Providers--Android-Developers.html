    Content providers manage access to a structured set of data. They encapsulate the
    data, and provide mechanisms for defining data security. Content providers are the standard
    interface that connects data in one process with code running in another process.
</p>
<p>
    When you want to access data in a content provider, you use the
    <code>ContentResolver</code> object in your
    application's <code>Context</code> to communicate with the provider as a client.
    The <code>ContentResolver</code> object communicates with the provider object, an
    instance of a class that implements <code>ContentProvider</code>. The provider
    object receives data requests from clients, performs the requested action, and
    returns the results.
</p>
<p>
    You don't need to develop your own provider if you don't intend to share your data with
    other applications. However, you do need your own provider to provide custom search
    suggestions in your own application. You also need your own provider if you want to copy and
    paste complex data or files from your application to other applications.
</p>
<p>
    Android itself includes content providers that manage data such as audio, video, images, and
    personal contact information. You can see some of them listed in the reference
    documentation for the
    <code>android.provider
    </code> package. With some restrictions, these providers are accessible to any Android
    application.
