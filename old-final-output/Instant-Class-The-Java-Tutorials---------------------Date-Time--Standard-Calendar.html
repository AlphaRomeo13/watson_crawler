<h1>Instant Class</h1>
<p>
One of the core classes of the Date-Time API is the
<tt>Instant</tt> class, which represents the start of a nanosecond on the timeline. This class is useful for generating a time stamp to represent machine time.</p>
<p>WHATSON? c04bbe0b-8847-4c11-b46e-da7fdb0ff38b</p>
<pre>
import java.time.Instant;

Instant timestamp = Instant.now();
</pre>
<p>
A value returned from the <tt>Instant</tt> class counts time beginning from the first second of January 1, 1970 (<tt>1970-01-01T00:00:00Z</tt>) also called the
<tt>EPOCH</tt>. An instant that occurs before the epoch has a negative value, and an instant that occurs after the epoch has a positive value.</p>
<p>
The other constants provided by the <tt>Instant</tt> class are
<tt>MIN</tt>, representing the smallest possible (far past) instant, and
<tt>MAX</tt>, representing the largest (far future) instant.</p>
<p>
Invoking <tt>toString</tt> on an <tt>Instant</tt> produces output like the following:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 5b48479d-c46e-4aaf-8213-6e713a2a856d</p>
<pre>

</pre>
<p>
This format follows the
ISO-8601 standard for representing date and time.</p>
<p>
The <tt>Instant</tt> class provides a variety of methods for manipulating an <tt>Instant</tt>. There are <tt>plus</tt> and <tt>minus</tt> methods for adding or subtracting time. The following code adds 1 hour to the current time:</p>
<p>WHATSON? d254bc23-d5aa-42c6-92f3-f40224d14c17</p>
<pre>
Instant oneHourLater = Instant.now().plusHours(1);
</pre>
<p>
There are methods for comparing instants, such as
<tt>isAfter</tt> and
<tt>isBefore</tt>. The 
<tt>until</tt> method returns how much time exists between two <tt>Instant</tt> objects. The following line of code reports how many seconds have occurred since the beginning of the Java epoch.</p>
<p>WHATSON? f4585f84-d7f3-44a9-8a52-9bc35ac88f5c</p>
<pre>
long secondsFromEpoch = Instant.ofEpochSecond(0L).until(Instant.now(),
                        ChronoUnit.SECONDS);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>Instant</tt> class does not work with human units of time, such as years, months, or days. If you want to perform calculations in those units, you can convert an <tt>Instant</tt> to another class, such as <tt>LocalDateTime</tt> or <tt>ZonedDateTime</tt>, by binding the <tt>Instant</tt> with a time zone. You can then access the value in the desired units. The following code converts an <tt>Instant</tt> to a <tt>LocalDateTime</tt> object using the
<tt>ofInstant</tt> method and the default time zone, and then prints out the date and time in a more readable form:</p>
<p>WHATSON? b014c417-0b97-4c10-ba5a-6a0fb656d535</p>
<pre>
Instant timestamp;
...
LocalDateTime ldt = LocalDateTime.ofInstant(timestamp, ZoneId.systemDefault());
System.out.printf("%s %d %d at %d:%d%n", ldt.getMonth(), ldt.getDayOfMonth(),
                  ldt.getYear(), ldt.getHour(), ldt.getMinute());
</pre>
<p>
The output will be similar to the following:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 746d6ac8-c65d-4883-bd53-8d3fe6d474cc</p>

<p>
Either a <tt>ZonedDateTime</tt> or an <tt>OffsetTimeZone</tt> object can be converted to an <tt>Instant</tt> object, as each maps to an exact moment on the timeline. However, the reverse is not true. To convert an <tt>Instant</tt> object to a <tt>ZonedDateTime</tt> or an <tt>OffsetDateTime</tt> object requires supplying time zone, or time zone offset, information.</p>
