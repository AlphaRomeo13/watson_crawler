<h1>Writing Final Classes and Methods</h1>
<p>You can declare some or all of a class's methods <i>final</i>. You use the <code>final</code> keyword in a method declaration to indicate that the method cannot be overridden by subclasses. The <code>Object</code> class does thisÂ—a number of its methods are <code>final</code>.</p>
<p>You might wish to make a method final if it has an implementation that should not be changed and it is critical to the consistent state of the object. For example, you might want to make the <code>getFirstPlayer</code> method in this <code>ChessAlgorithm</code> class final:</p>

<pre>
class ChessAlgorithm {
    enum ChessPlayer { WHITE, BLACK }
    ...
    <b>final</b> ChessPlayer getFirstPlayer() {
        return ChessPlayer.WHITE;
    }
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>Methods called from constructors should generally be declared final. If a constructor calls a non-final method, a subclass may redefine that method with surprising or undesirable results.</p>
<p>Note that you can also declare an entire class final. A class that is declared final cannot be subclassed. This is particularly useful, for example, when creating an immutable class like the <code>String</code> class.</p>
