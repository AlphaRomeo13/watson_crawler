<h1>Run-time type information</h1>
<p>In computer programming, <b>RTTI</b> (<b>Run-Time Type Information</b>, or <b>Run-Time Type Identification</b>) refers to a C++ mechanism that exposes information about an object's data type at runtime. Run-time type information can apply to simple data types, such as integers and characters, or to generic types. This is a C++ specialization of a more general concept called type introspection. Similar mechanisms are also known in other programming languages, such as Delphi (Object Pascal).</p>
<p>In the original C++ design, Bjarne Stroustrup did not include run-time type information, because he thought this mechanism was frequently misused.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>The <code>dynamic_cast&lt;&gt;</code> operation and <code>typeid</code> operator in C++ are part of RTTI.</p>
<p>The C++ run-time type information permits performing safe typecasts and manipulate type information at run time.</p>
<p>RTTI is available only for classes which are polymorphic, which means they have at least one virtual method. In practice, this is not a limitation because base classes must have a virtual destructor to allow objects of derived classes to perform proper cleanup if they are deleted from a base pointer.</p>
<p>RTTI is optional with some compilers; the programmer can choose at compile time whether to include the function. There may be a resource cost to making RTTI available even if the program does not use it.</p>

/* A base class pointer can point to objects of any class which is derived

<p>An instance where RTTI is used is illustrated below:</p>

class Base
{
public:  
    virtual ~Base(){}
};
 
class Derived : public Base
{
public:
    Derived() {}
    virtual ~Derived() {}
 
    int compare (Derived&amp; ref);
};
 
int myComparisonMethodForGenericSort (Base&amp; ref1, Base&amp; ref2)
{
    Derived&amp; d = dynamic_cast&lt;Derived&amp;&gt;(ref1); //RTTI used here
    //Note: If the cast is not successful, RTTI enables the process to throw a bad_cast exception
 
    return d.compare (dynamic_cast&lt;Derived&amp;&gt;(ref2));
