<h1>Immutable object</h1>
<p>In object-oriented and functional programming, an <b>immutable object</b> is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. This is in contrast to a <b>mutable object</b>, which can be modified after it is created. In some cases, an object is considered immutable even if some internally used attributes change but the object's state appears to be unchanging from an external point of view. For example, an object that uses memoization to cache the results of expensive computations could still be considered an immutable object.</p>
<p>Immutable objects are often useful because they are inherently thread-safe. Other benefits are that they are simpler to understand and reason about and offer higher security than mutable objects.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In imperative programming, values held in program variables whose content never changes are known as <i>constants</i> to differentiate them from variables that could be altered during execution. Examples might include conversion factors from kilogram weights to pounds or the value of Pi to several decimal places. In most object-oriented languages, objects can be referred to using references. Some examples of such languages are Java, C++, C#, VB.NET, and many scripting languages, such as Python and Ruby. In this case, it matters whether the state of an object can vary when objects are shared via references.</p>
<p>If an object is known to be immutable, it can be copied simply by making a copy of a reference to it instead of copying the entire object. Because a reference (typically only the size of a pointer) is usually much smaller than the object itself, this results in memory savings and a potential boost in execution speed.</p>
<p>The reference copying technique is much more difficult to use for mutable objects, because if any user of a reference to a mutable object changes it, all other users of that reference will see the change. If this is not the intended effect, it can be difficult to notify the other users to have them respond correctly. In these situations, defensive copying of the entire object rather than the reference is usually an easy but costly solution. The observer pattern is an alternative technique for handling changes to mutable objects.</p>
<p>Immutable objects can be useful in multi-threaded applications. Multiple threads can act on data represented by immutable objects without concern of the data being changed by other threads. Immutable objects are therefore considered to be more <i>thread-safe</i> than mutable objects.</p>
<p>The practice of always using references in place of copies of equal objects is known as <i>interning</i>. If interning is used, two objects are considered equal if and only if their references, typically represented as integers, are equal. Some languages do this automatically: for example, Python automatically interns short strings. If the algorithm that implements interning is guaranteed to do so in every case that it is possible, then comparing objects for equality is reduced to comparing their pointers – a substantial gain in speed in most applications. (Even if the algorithm is not guaranteed to be comprehensive, there still exists the possibility of a fast path case improvement when the objects are equal and use the same reference.) Interning is generally only useful for immutable objects.</p>
<p>Sometimes, one talks of certain <i>fields</i> of an object being immutable. This means that there is no way to change those parts of the object state, even though other parts of the object may be changeable (<i>weakly immutable</i>). If all fields are immutable, then the object is immutable. If the whole object cannot be extended by another class, the object is called <i>strongly immutable</i>. This might, for example, help to explicitly enforce certain invariants about certain data in the object staying the same through the lifetime of the object. In some languages, this is done with a keyword (e.g. <code>const</code> in C++, <code>final</code> in Java) that designates the field to be immutable. In some languages, it is reversed: in OCaml, fields of an object or record are by default immutable and need to be explicitly marked with <code>mutable</code> to be so.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>Immutability does not imply that the object as stored in the computer's memory is unwriteable. Rather, immutability is a compile-time construct that indicates what a programmer can do through the normal interface of the object, not necessarily what they can absolutely do (for instance, by circumventing the type system or violating const correctness in C or C++).</p>
<h3>Ada</h3>
<p>In Ada, any object is declared either <i>variable</i> (i.e. mutable; typically the implicit default), or <code>constant</code> (i.e. immutable) via the <code>constant</code> keyword.</p>
<p>WHATSON? 75322c88-c0c0-4b05-b417-fe24e4d3a9ea</p>
<pre>
  type Some_type is new Integer; -- could be anything more complicated
  x: constant Some_type:= 1; -- immutable
  y: Some_type; -- mutable
</pre>
<p>Subprogram parameters are immutable in the <i>in</i> mode, and mutable in the <i>in out</i> and <i>out</i> modes.</p>
<p>WHATSON? 180b3660-e5ab-4b02-a9f3-9d383b00793a</p>
<pre>
  procedure Do_it(a: in Integer; b: in out Integer; c: out Integer) is
  begin
    -- a is immutable
    b:= b + a;
    c:= a;
  end Do_it;
</pre>
<h3>C++</h3>
<p>In C++, a const-correct implementation of <code>Cart</code> would allow the user to declare new instances of the class as either <code>const</code> (immutable) or mutable, as desired, by providing two different versions of the <code>getItems()</code> method. (Notice that in C++ it is not necessary — and in fact impossible — to provide a specialized constructor for <code>const</code> instances.)</p>
<p>WHATSON? 15d78065-6f3b-4366-becf-3f15376970ed</p>
<pre>
template&lt;typename T&gt;
class Cart {
  private:
   std::vector&lt;T&gt; items;
 
  public:
   Cart(const std::vector&lt;T&gt;&amp; v): items(v) { }
 
   std::vector&lt;T&gt;&amp; getItems() { return items; }
   const std::vector&lt;T&gt;&amp; getItems() const { return items; }
   int total() const { /* return sum of the prices */ }
 };
</pre>
<p>Note that, if there were a field that is a pointer or reference to another object, then it might still be possible to mutate the object pointed to by such a pointer or reference within a const method, without violating const-correctness. It can be argued that in such a case the object is not really immutable.</p>
<p>C++ also provides abstract (as opposed to bitwise) immutability via the <code>mutable</code> keyword, which allows a member variable to be changed from within a <code>const</code> method.</p>
<p>WHATSON? c4b127c8-864b-44af-bc16-f3203bc86dac</p>
<pre>
template&lt;typename T&gt;
class Cart {
  private:
   std::vector&lt;T&gt; items;
   mutable int    costInCents;
   mutable bool   totaled;
 
  public:
   Cart(const std::vector&lt;T&gt;&amp; v): items(v), totaled(false) { }
 
   const std::vector&lt;T&gt;&amp; getItems() const { return items; }
   int total() const {
      if (!totaled) {
         costInCents = 0;
         for (std::vector&lt;T&gt;::const_iterator itor = items.begin(); itor != items.end(); ++itor)
            costInCents += itor-&gt;costInCents();
 
         totaled = true;
      }
      return costInCents;
   }
 };
</pre>
<h3>Java</h3>
<p>A classic example of an immutable object is an instance of the Java <code>String</code> class.</p>
<p>WHATSON? c9c9e568-5fa8-41c1-bc19-03549cbaee2c</p>
<pre>
String s = "ABC";
s.toLowerCase();
</pre>
<p>The method <code>toLowerCase()</code> will not change the data "ABC" that <code>s</code> contains. Instead, a new String object is instantiated and given the data "abc" during its construction. A reference to this String object is returned by the <code>toLowerCase()</code> method. To make the String <code>s</code> contain the data "abc", a different approach is needed.</p>
<p>WHATSON? a2d5fa3f-f9d3-43e5-a93f-31b26403429a</p>
<pre>
s = s.toLowerCase();
</pre>
<p>Now the String <code>s</code> references a new String object that contains "abc". There is nothing in the syntax of the <i>declaration</i> of the class String that enforces it as immutable; rather, none of the String class's methods ever affect the data that a String object contains, thus making it immutable.</p>
<p><code>final</code> (detailed article) keyword is used in implementing immutable primitive types and object references, but it itself <i>cannot make other objects immutable</i>. See below examples:</p>
<p>Primitive type variables (<code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>short</code>, etc.) can be reassigned after being defined. We can prevent this using <code>final</code>.</p>
<p>WHATSON? 17773527-aa24-45ee-89fb-67c8ea463c37</p>
<pre>
int i = 42; //int is of primitive type
i = 43; // OK
 
final int j = 42;
j = 43; // does not compile. j is final so can't be reassigned
</pre>
<p>Reference types cannot be made immutable just by using the <code>final</code> keyword. <code>final</code> only prevents reassignment.</p>
<p>WHATSON? 9eeb6e85-79bd-4e48-862d-74758c8b32ed</p>
<pre>
final MyObject m = new MyObject(); //m is of reference type
m.data = 100; // OK. We can change state of object m (m is mutable and final doesn't change this fact)
m = new MyObject(); // does not compile. m is final so can't be reassigned
</pre>
<p>Primitive wrappers (<code>Integer</code>, <code>Long</code>, <code>Short</code>, <code>Double</code>, <code>Float</code>, <code>Character</code>, <code>Byte</code>, <code>Boolean</code>) are also all immutable. Immutable classes can be implemented by following a few simple guidelines.</p>
<h3>Perl</h3>
<p>In Perl, you can create an immutable class with Moo by simply declaring all the attributes to be read only:</p>
<p>WHATSON? aff378e7-02fe-41ba-97d5-f76bd2a69ecf</p>
<pre>
package Immutable;
use Moo;
 
has value =&gt; (
	is      =&gt; 'ro',   # read only
	default =&gt; 'data', # can be overridden by supplying the constructor with
	                   # a value: Immutable-&gt;new(value =&gt; 'something else');
);
1;
</pre>
<p>Creating an immutable class used to require two steps: first, creating accessors (either automatically or manually) that prevent modification of object attributes, and secondly, preventing direct modification of the instance data of instances of that class (this was usually stored in a hash reference, and could be locked with Hash::Util's lock_hash function):</p>
<p>WHATSON? 1230f406-b805-4256-8938-3d00194509d6</p>
<pre>
package Immutable;
use strict;
use warnings;
use base qw(Class::Accessor);
# create read-only accessors
__PACKAGE__-&gt;mk_ro_accessors(qw(value));
use Hash::Util 'lock_hash';
 
sub new {
	my $class = shift;
	return $class if ref($class);
	die "Arguments to new must be key =&gt; value pairs\n"
		unless (@_ % 2 == 0);
	my %defaults = (
		value =&gt; 'data',
	);
	my $obj = {
		%defaults,
		@_,
	};
	bless $obj, $class;
	# prevent modification of the object data
	lock_hash %$obj;
}
1;
</pre>
<p>Or, with a manually written accessor:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 582d7275-4fcf-46e1-938c-a8d198271390</p>
<pre>
package Immutable;
use strict;
use warnings;
use Hash::Util 'lock_hash';
 
sub new {
	my $class = shift;
	return $class if ref($class);
	die "Arguments to new must be key =&gt; value pairs\n"
		unless (@_ % 2 == 0);
	my %defaults = (
		value =&gt; 'data',
	);
	my $obj = {
		%defaults,
		@_,
	};
	bless $obj, $class;
	# prevent modification of the object data
	lock_hash %$obj;
}
 
# read-only accessor
sub value {
	my $self = shift;
	if (my $new_value = shift) {
		# trying to set a new value
		die "This object cannot be modified\n";
	} else {
		return $self-&gt;{value}
	}
}
1;
</pre>
<h3>Python</h3>
<p>In Python, some built-in types (numbers, booleans, strings, tuples, frozensets) are immutable, but custom classes are generally mutable. To simulate immutability in a class, one should override attribute setting and deletion to raise exceptions:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 0c5600ce-1f31-4f00-a58b-0da2dcff12fc</p>
<pre>
class Immutable(object):
     """An immutable class with a single attribute 'value'."""
     def __setattr__(self, *args):
         raise TypeError("can't modify immutable instance")
     __delattr__ = __setattr__
     def __init__(self, value):
         # we can no longer use self.value = value to store the instance data
         # so we must explicitly call the superclass
         super(Immutable, self).__setattr__('value', value)
</pre>
<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<p>In JavaScript, some built-in types (numbers, strings) are immutable, but custom classes are generally mutable. To simulate immutability in a class, one should set immutable properties to prototype of object:</p>

    function Immutable () {}
</pre>
<p>One can also use Object.freeze to make existing objects immutable.</p>
<h3>Racket</h3>
<p>Racket substantially diverges from other Scheme implementations by making its core pair type ("cons cells") immutable. Instead, it provides a parallel mutable pair type, via <code>mcons</code>, <code>mcar</code>, <code>set-mcar!</code> etc. In addition, many immutable types are supported, for example, immutable strings and vectors, and these are used extensively. New structs are immutable by default, unless a field is specifically declared mutable, or the whole struct:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 8382b67c-c39f-4146-9d00-2ce2e19cc3a2</p>
<pre>
(struct foo1 (x y))             ; all fields immutable
(struct foo2 (x [y #:mutable])) ; one mutable field
(struct foo3 (x y) #:mutable)   ; all fields mutable
</pre>
<p>The language also supports immutable hash tables, implemented functionally, and immutable dictionaries.</p>
<h3>Scala</h3>
<p>In Scala, any entity (narrowly, a binding) can be defined as mutable or immutable: in the declaration, one can use <code>val</code> (value) for immutable entities and <code>var</code> (variable) for mutable ones. Note that even though an immutable binding can not be reassigned, it may still refer to a mutable object and it is still possible to call mutating methods on that object: the <i>binding</i> is immutable, but the underlying <i>object</i> may be mutable.</p>
<p>For example, the following code snippet:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 179a4afb-9eda-48c5-9342-e807d2fde613</p>
<pre>
val maxValue = 100
var currentValue = 1
</pre>
<p>defines an immutable entity <code>maxValue</code> (the integer type is inferred at compile-time) and a mutable entity named <code>currentValue</code>.</p>
<p>By default, collection classes such as <code>List</code> and <code>Map</code> are immutable, so update-methods return a new instance rather than mutating an existing one. While this may sound inefficient, the implementation of these classes and their guarantees of immutability mean that the new instance can re-use existing nodes, which, especially in the case of creating copies, is very efficient.</p>
<h2>Copy-on-write</h2>
<p>A technique that blends the advantages of <b>mutable</b> and <b>immutable</b> objects, and is supported directly in almost all modern hardware, is copy-on-write (COW). Using this technique, when a user asks the system to copy an object, it will instead merely create a new reference that still points to the same object. As soon as a user modifies the object through a particular reference, the system makes a real copy and sets the reference to refer to the new copy. The other users are unaffected, because they still refer to the original object. Therefore, under COW, all users appear to have a mutable version of their objects, although in the case that users do not modify their objects, the space-saving and speed advantages of immutable objects are preserved. Copy-on-write is popular in virtual memory systems because it allows them to save memory space while still correctly handling anything an application program might do.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Strings and other concrete objects are typically expressed as immutable objects to improve readability and runtime efficiency in object-oriented programming. In Python, Java and the .NET Framework, strings are immutable objects. Both Java and the .NET Framework have mutable versions of string. In Java these are <code>StringBuffer</code> and <code>StringBuilder</code> (mutable versions of Java <code>String</code>) and in .NET this is <code>StringBuilder</code> (mutable version of .Net <code>String</code>). Python 3 has a mutable string (bytes) variant, named <code>bytearray</code>.[1]</p>
<p>Additionally, all of the primitive wrapper classes in Java are immutable.</p>
<p>Enforcement of the pattern can be checked by using specialized compilers (see for example http://pec.dev.java.net/), and there is a proposal to add immutable types to Java.</p>
<p>Similar patterns are the Immutable Interface and Immutable Wrapper.</p>
<p>In pure functional programming languages it is not possible to create mutable objects, so all objects are immutable.</p>
