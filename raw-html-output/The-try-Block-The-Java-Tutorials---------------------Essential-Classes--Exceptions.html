<h1>The try Block</h1>
<p>The first step in constructing an exception handler is to enclose the code that might throw an exception within a <code>try</code> block. In general, a <code>try</code> block looks like the following:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 6b07d277-edd2-4f96-afa7-3789626513bf</p>
<pre>
try {
    <em>code</em>
}
<em>catch and finally blocks . . .</em>
</pre>
<p>The segment in the example labeled <code><em>code</em></code> contains one or more legal lines of code that could throw an exception. (The <code>catch</code> and <code>finally</code> blocks are explained in the next two subsections.)</p>
<p>To construct an exception handler for the <code>writeList</code> method from the <code>ListOfNumbers</code> class, enclose the exception-throwing statements of the <code>writeList</code> method within a <code>try</code> block. There is more than one way to do this. You can put each line of code that might throw an exception within its own <code>try</code> block and provide separate exception handlers for each. Or, you can put all the <code>writeList</code> code within a single <code>try</code> block and associate multiple handlers with it. The following listing uses one <code>try</code> block for the entire method because the code in question is very short.</p>
<p>WHATSON? f9689a9e-9fec-4440-b955-758c9fad6a1c</p>
<pre>
private List&lt;Integer&gt; list;
private static final int SIZE = 10;

public void writeList() {
    PrintWriter out = null;
    try {
        System.out.println("Entered try statement");
        out = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter("OutFile.txt"));
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; SIZE; i++) {
            out.println("Value at: " + i + " = " + list.get(i));
        }
    }
    catch and finally blocks  . . .
}
</pre>
<p>If an exception occurs within the <code>try</code> block, that exception is handled by an exception handler associated with it. To associate an exception handler with a <code>try</code> block, you must put a <code>catch</code> block after it; the next section, 
<a class="TutorialLink" target="_top" href="catch.html">The catch Blocks</a>, shows you how.</p>
