<h1>Processes and Threads</h1>
<p>In concurrent programming, there are two basic units of execution: <i>processes</i> and <i>threads</i>. In the Java programming language, concurrent programming is mostly concerned with threads. However, processes are also important.</p>
<p>A computer system normally has many active processes and threads. This is true even in systems that only have a single execution core, and thus only have one thread actually executing at any given moment. Processing time for a single core is shared among processes and threads through an OS feature called time slicing.</p>
<p>It's becoming more and more common for computer systems to have multiple processors or processors with multiple execution cores. This greatly enhances a system's capacity for concurrent execution of processes and threads  but concurrency is possible even on simple systems, without multiple processors or execution cores.</p>
<h2>Processes</h2>
<p>A process has a self-contained execution environment. A process generally has a complete, private set of basic run-time resources; in particular, each process has its own memory space.</p>
<p>Processes are often seen as synonymous with programs or applications. However, what the user sees as a single application may in fact be a set of cooperating processes. To facilitate communication between processes, most operating systems support <i>Inter Process Communication</i> (IPC) resources, such as pipes and sockets. IPC is used not just for communication between processes on the same system, but processes on different systems.</p>
<p>Most implementations of the Java virtual machine run as a single process. A Java application can create additional processes using a 
<a class="APILink" target="_blank" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/ProcessBuilder.html"><code>ProcessBuilder</code></a> object. Multiprocess applications are beyond the scope of this lesson.</p>
<h2>Threads</h2>
<p>Threads are sometimes called <i>lightweight processes</i>. Both processes and threads provide an execution environment, but creating a new thread requires fewer resources than creating a new process.</p>
<p>Threads exist within a process  every process has at least one. Threads share the process's resources, including memory and open files. This makes for efficient, but potentially problematic, communication.</p>
<p>Multithreaded execution is an essential feature of the Java platform. Every application has at least one thread  or several, if you count "system" threads that do things like memory management and signal handling. But from the application programmer's point of view, you start with just one thread, called the <i>main thread</i>. This thread has the ability to create additional threads, as we'll demonstrate in the next section.</p>
