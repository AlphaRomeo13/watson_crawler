<h1>Questions and Exercises: Implementations</h1>
<h2>Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>You plan to write a program that uses several basic collection interfaces: <code>Set</code>, <code>List</code>, <code>Queue</code>, and <code>Map</code>. You're not sure which implementations will work best, so you decide to use general-purpose implementations until you get a better idea how your program will work in the real world. Which implementations are these?</li>
<li>If you need a <code>Set</code> implementation that provides value-ordered iteration, which class should you use?</li>
<li>Which class do you use to access wrapper implementations?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Exercises</h2>
<ol>
<li>Write a program that reads a text file, specified by the first command line argument, into a <code>List</code>. The program should then print random lines from the file, the number of lines printed to be specified by the second command line argument. Write the program so that a correctly-sized collection is allocated all at once, instead of being gradually expanded as the file is read in. Hint: To determine the number of lines in the file, use
