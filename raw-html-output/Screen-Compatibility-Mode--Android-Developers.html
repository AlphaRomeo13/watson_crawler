<p>Screen compatibility mode is an escape hatch for applications that are not properly designed
to resize for larger screens such as tablets. Since Android 1.6, Android has supported a
variety of screen sizes and does most of the work to resize application layouts so that they
properly fit each screen. However, if your application does not successfully follow the guide to
<a href="/guide/practices/screens_support.html">Supporting Multiple Screens</a>,
then it might encounter some rendering issues on larger screens. For applications with this
problem, screen compatibility mode can make the application a little more usable on larger
screens.</p>
<p>There are two versions of screen compatibility mode with slightly different behaviors:</p>
<p>This was introduced with Android 1.6 to handle apps that were designed only for the
original screen size of 320dp x 480dp. Because there are so few active devices remaining that run
Android 1.5, almost all applications should be developed against Android 1.6 or greater and
should not have version 1 of screen compatibility mode enabled for larger screens. This version
is considered obsolete.</p>
<p>To disable this version of screen compatibility mode, you simply need to set <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#min"><code>android:minSdkVersion</code></a> or <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#target"><code>android:targetSdkVersion</code></a> to <code>"4"</code> or higher, or set <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/supports-screens-element.html#resizeable"><code>android:resizeable</code></a> to <code>"true"</code>.</p>
<p>This was introduced with Android 3.2 to further
assist applications on the latest tablet devices when the applications have not yet
implemented techniques for <a href="/guide/practices/screens_support.html">Supporting Multiple
Screens</a>.</p>
<p>In general, large screen devices running Android 3.2 or higher allow users to enable
screen compatibility mode when the application does not <strong>explicitly declare that it supports
large screens</strong> in the manifest file. When this is the case, an icon (with
outward-pointing arrows) appears next to the clock in the system bar, which allows the user to
toggle screen compatibility mode on and off (figure 3). An application can also explicitly
declare that it <em>does not</em> support large screens such that screen compatibility mode
is always enabled and the user cannot disable it. (How to declare your application's
support for large screens is discussed in the following sections.)</p>
<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 3.</strong> The pop up menu to toggle screen compatibility

<p>As a developer, you have control over when your application uses screen compatibility mode. The
following sections describe how you can choose to disable or enable screen compatibility mode for
larger screens when running Android 3.2 or higher.</p>
<h2 id="Disable">Disabling Screen Compatibility Mode</h2>
<p>If you've developed your application primarily for versions of Android lower than 3.0, but
<strong>your application does resize properly</strong> for larger screens such as tablets,
<strong>you should disable screen compatibility mode</strong> in order to maintain the best user
experience. Otherwise, users may enable screen compatibility mode and experience your application in
a less-than-ideal format.</p>
<p>By default, screen compatibility mode for devices running Android 3.2 and higher is offered to
users as an optional feature when one of the following is true:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your application has set both <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#min"><code>android:minSdkVersion</code></a>
and <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#target"><code>android:targetSdkVersion</code></a> to <code>"10"</code> or lower and <strong>does not explicitly
declare support</strong> for large screens using the <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/supports-screens-element.html"><code>&lt;supports-screens&gt;</code></a> element.</li>

  <li>Your application has set either <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#min"><code>android:minSdkVersion</code></a>
or <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#target"><code>android:targetSdkVersion</code></a> to <code>"11"</code> or higher and <strong>explicitly declares that it does
not support</strong> large screens, using the <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/supports-screens-element.html"><code>&lt;supports-screens&gt;</code></a> element.</li>
</ul>
<p>To completely disable the user option for screen compatibility mode and remove the icon in the
system bar, you can do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Easiest:</strong>
    <p>In your manifest file, add the <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/supports-screens-element.html"><code>&lt;supports-screens&gt;</code></a> element and specify the <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/supports-screens-element.html#xlarge"><code>android:xlargeScreens</code></a> attribute to <code>"true"</code>:</p>
<pre>
&lt;supports-screens android:xlargeScreens="true" /&gt;
</pre>
  <p>That's it. This declares that your application supports all larger screen sizes, so the
system will always resize your layout to fit the screen. This works regardless of what values
you've set in the <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html"><code>&lt;uses-sdk&gt;</code></a>
attributes.</p> 
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>Easy but has other effects:</strong>
    <p>In your manifest's <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html"><code>&lt;uses-sdk&gt;</code></a>
element, set <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#target"><code>android:targetSdkVersion</code></a> to <code>"11"</code> or higher:</p>
<pre>
&lt;uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="4" android:targetSdkVersion="11" /&gt;
</pre>
  <p>This declares that your application supports Android 3.0 and, thus, is designed to
work on larger screens such as tablets.</p>
  <p class="caution"><strong>Caution:</strong> When running on Android 3.0 and greater, this also
has the effect of enabling the Holographic theme for you UI, adding the <a href="/guide/topics/ui/actionbar.html">Action Bar</a> to your activities, and removing the
Options Menu button in the system bar.</p>
  <p>If screen compatibility mode is still enabled after you change this, check your manifest's <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/supports-screens-element.html"><code>&lt;supports-screens&gt;</code></a> and be sure that there are no attributes set <code>"false"</code>. The best
practice is to always explicitly declare your support for different screen sizes using the <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/supports-screens-element.html"><code>&lt;supports-screens&gt;</code></a> element, so you should use this element anyway.</p>

<h2 id="Enable">Enabling Screen Compatibility Mode</h2>
<p>When your application is targeting Android 3.2 (API level 13) or higher, you can affect
whether compatibility mode is enabled for certain screens by using the <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/supports-screens-element.html"><code>&lt;supports-screens&gt;</code></a> element.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Screen compatibility mode is <strong>not</strong> a mode in
which you should want your application to run—it causes pixelation and blurring in your UI,
due to zooming. The proper way to make your application work well on large screens is to follow the
guide to <a href="/guide/practices/screens_support.html">Supporting Multiple Screens</a> and
provide alternative layouts for different screen sizes.</p>

  <li>If your application is functionally broken when resized for large screens and you want to
force users into screen compatibility mode (rather than simply providing the option), you can use
the <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/supports-screens-element.html#largestWidth"><code>android:largestWidthLimitDp</code></a> attribute:
<pre>
&lt;supports-screens android:largestWidthLimitDp="320" /&gt;
</pre>
  <p>This works the same as <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/supports-screens-element.html#compatibleWidth"><code>android:compatibleWidthLimitDp</code></a> except it force-enables
screen compatibility mode and does not allow users to disable it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>WHATSON? a78fa8c7-0873-489d-81c8-434220aed732</p>
<pre>
&lt;supports-screens android:compatibleWidthLimitDp="320" /&gt;
</pre>
<p>This indicates that the maximum "smallest screen width" for which your application is designed
is 320dp. This way, any devices with their smallest side being larger than this value will offer
screen compatibility mode as a user-optional feature.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Currently, screen compatibility mode only emulates
handset screens with a 320dp width, so screen compatibility mode is not applied to any device if
your value for <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/supports-screens-element.html#compatibleWidth"><code>android:compatibleWidthLimitDp</code></a> is larger than 320.</p>
