<p>Can anyone give a <b>good</b> comparison between <i>Gene Expression Programming (GEP)</i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Linear_genetic_programming" title="Linear genetic programming">Linear Genetic Programming (LGP)</a></i>? According to this article, it seems that the only difference between GEP and Genetic Programming (of which LGP is a subset) is how programs, in the population to evolve, are represented. Quoting the relevant fragment:</p>
<p>"In Genetic Programming the individuals comprising a population are <b>typically</b> symbolic expression trees; however, the individuals comprising a population of GEP are encoded as linear chromosomes, which are then translated into expression trees. That is, in GEP, the genotype (the linear chromosomes) and the phenotype (the expression trees) have a different encoding structure."</p>
<p>Emphasis mine. Now, "<i>typically</i>" does not exclude other representations, indeed LGP is a counter-example. In LGP each program from the population is represented as a sequence of instructions, sometimes directly as machine instructions as in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~wbl/biblio/gp-html/nordin_thesis.html">the approach of Peter Nordin</a>, which doesn't need a translation phase "<i>from genotype to phenotype</i>", to use GEP questionable terminology (IMO the author doesn't understand the difference between a process - a running program - and its specification - a program properly encoded; using GEP analogy, a program is always genotype). I concur with section "<b>Dubious claims throughout</b>" below, where the merits of such translation in GEP is questioned. --<a href="/wiki/User:MaD70" title="User:MaD70">MaD70</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:MaD70" title="User talk:MaD70">talk</a>) 15:27, 24 January 2010 (UTC)</p>

<p>"This new algorithm surpasses the old GP system <i>in 100-10,000 times</i>." What does this mean? Is it 100-10,000 times <i>faster</i>?

<p>Here is some "original research" (i.e. glaringly obvious points):</p>
<p>In GEP, the mapping from genotype to phenotype is <i>deterministic</i> and <i>static</i>; as such, GEP is nothing more than GP with a convoluted encoding--In fact, I would argue it is significantly <i>less</i>. As a consequence of the high non-linearity of GEP's genotype-to-phenotype mapping, offspring generated via recombination bear very little resemblance to their parents. GEP is thus, effectively, GP with a broken recombination operator, such that runs degenerate into near-random search and simple hill-climbing.</p>
<p>I am nothing less than shocked that these ideas have been accepted for print. Consider:</p>
<p>In section 6.1 of the paper, a GEP "evolves" solutions to the regression problem: <i>a</i>^4 + <i>a</i>^3 + <i>a</i>^2 + <i>a</i>. Note how this is a <i>very</i> easy problem--there aren't even any coefficients to determine! In any case, I replicated the experiment with the same settings, in Matlab. Know what I found out (confirmed)? With a population size of 30 individuals, and 50 generations, simply randomly generating individuals yields comparable performance to this "revolutionary" algorithm! That is, (30x50=)1500 random guesses is usually enough to guess a solution</p>
<p>Where does the claim to 10,000x improvement come from? It may be enlightening to examine the text accompanying Figure 11: <i>"Plot 1: ... a perfect solution was found in generation 1. Plot 2: ... a perfect solution was found in generation 3. Plot 3: ... a perfect solution was found in generation 2. Plot 4: ... a perfect solution was found in generation 3. Plot 5: a perfect solution was found in generation 1."</i> I call bullshit. If your <i>stochastic approximating algorithm</i> is finding perfect solutions after only a handful of generations, you should be suspicious! Clearly, either the problem is too easy, the driver routine is misreporting results, or the researcher is fabricating them. I would prefer not to believe this last, but could the severe problems with this algorithm be any more obvious? How could someone continue on this topic for so many years, even publishing books(!) on it, without realizing its readily apparent flaws?<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/65.183.135.231" title="Special:Contributions/65.183.135.231">65.183.135.231</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:65.183.135.231" title="User talk:65.183.135.231">talk</a>) 03:04, 29 October 2008 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am finding it hard to find journals and other researchers citing GEP except in a few passing mentions (2 brief mentions in the GP and evolable machines journal) which is a little concerning. As an absolute beginner to the subject of GP I do find the solutions being found after one generation a little suspicious, however theres nothing I can find condeming it either so for the purposes of wikipedia your 'original research' points are moot. If you can find peer reviews on GEP i'd like to see them (I need them for a literature review!) <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/138.253.136.37" title="Special:Contributions/138.253.136.37">138.253.136.37</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:138.253.136.37&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:138.253.136.37 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 16:25, 30 October 2008 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi, given the novelty of the method, that the developer is biologist and woman and seeing how GEP citation is extending all over the www (a second edition of the book by Springer should give us some clue) I am able to predict that this kind of evolutionary algorithm will become standard practice in the field. Congrats to Ferreira! (whom by the way I have no relationship and never met with): I am just a evolutionary biologist and computer engineer interested in evolutionary computation. I am pasting here some links for (I think) independent references that seems to sustain Ferreiro's claims on GEP.</p>
<p>the first compares GEP with GP and linear regression:</p>

<p>1. Apparently, in addition to a great number of other researchers, John Koza himself, the inventor of genetic programming, *supposedly* (a less indirect source is wanted for such a claim--EDIT: see #8, below) took the time to speak out against this nonsense: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://coding.derkeiler.com/Archive/Lisp/comp.lang.lisp/2008-08/msg01136.html">[7]</a> <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/74.64.96.71" title="Special:Contributions/74.64.96.71">74.64.96.71</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:74.64.96.71" title="User talk:74.64.96.71">talk</a>) 09:19, 14 October 2010 (UTC)</p>
<p>2. Here we have folks saying the results in the paper suggest "that the mutation and crossover algorithms are performing near-randomization" (i.e. random search): <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/genetic_programming/message/66">[8]</a> They also point out that, despite the claims, the paper doesn't actually compare GEP to any other algorithms. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/74.64.96.71" title="Special:Contributions/74.64.96.71">74.64.96.71</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:74.64.96.71" title="User talk:74.64.96.71">talk</a>) 09:27, 14 October 2010 (UTC)</p>
<p>3. Technically not a critical response, but check out Ferreira's response to the above: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/genetic_programming/message/69">[9]</a>. She resorts to Random Capitalization and forceful Blustering without Addressing Any Points. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/74.64.96.71" title="Special:Contributions/74.64.96.71">74.64.96.71</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:74.64.96.71" title="User talk:74.64.96.71">talk</a>) 09:32, 14 October 2010 (UTC)</p>
<p>4. Brilliant layout of the problems here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/genetic_programming/message/83">[10]</a>. I believe this is Sean Luke at GMU (someone who actually retained a professorship past the publication date of their thesis--and at a not-too-shabby institution, for that matter). <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/74.64.96.71" title="Special:Contributions/74.64.96.71">74.64.96.71</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:74.64.96.71" title="User talk:74.64.96.71">talk</a>) 09:36, 14 October 2010 (UTC)</p>
<p>5. Another such thread. Argues grossly unsubstantiated inference and unwarranted self-aggrandizement; also, that the work is subsumed by grammatical evolution (GE) and others, in addition to misleadingly citing Koza's famous paper: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/genetic_programming/message/75">[11]</a> Bill Mydlowec. Stanford. Worked with Koza. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/74.64.96.71" title="Special:Contributions/74.64.96.71">74.64.96.71</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:74.64.96.71" title="User talk:74.64.96.71">talk</a>) 09:44, 14 October 2010 (UTC)</p>
<p>6. Here we have Dr. Conor Ryan of the University of Limerick, the inventor of grammatical evolution (GE) informally demonstrating GEP is a mere subset of GE: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/genetic_programming/message/82">[12]</a>. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/74.64.96.71" title="Special:Contributions/74.64.96.71">74.64.96.71</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:74.64.96.71" title="User talk:74.64.96.71">talk</a>) 09:49, 14 October 2010 (UTC)</p>
<p>7. Again, not a critical response, but Candida's own words (which consistently serve the same effect): "GAs are good at parameter optimization, a task GP cannot handle, although GEP, more related to GP than GAs, can handle this kind of problem very well." That's right--GP "cannot handle" "parameter optimization" (despite the fact that GA, which *of course* can optimize a vector of parameters, is a subset of GP). <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/genetic_programming/message/2085">[13]</a> Martin Sewell, from the University of Cambridge, points this out (except inadvertently saying GP is subset of GA, rather than vice versa), and not so subtly suggests that, in comparison, GEP is "overtly more commercial". Probably because half of Ferreira's posts are soliciting people to buy her books or software. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/74.64.96.71" title="Special:Contributions/74.64.96.71">74.64.96.71</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:74.64.96.71" title="User talk:74.64.96.71">talk</a>) 10:12, 14 October 2010 (UTC)</p>

<p>8. Here we have John Koza (the Man himself) dismiss Ferreira very concisely, after she suggests he is ignorant of some fairly basic ideas: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/genetic_programming/message/2103">[15]</a>. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/74.64.96.71" title="Special:Contributions/74.64.96.71">74.64.96.71</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:74.64.96.71" title="User talk:74.64.96.71">talk</a>) 10:14, 14 October 2010 (UTC)</p>
<p>9. Here, Maarten Keijzer suggests GEP is so "trivial" that "GEP as such shouldn't [even] be mentioned in the GP-tree" <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/genetic_programming/message/2638">[16]</a> He suggests "overall, [it] made the list by virtue of the [author's] high annoyance factor, high likeliness of being provoked, and a level of stubbornness and absence of reason that [he] hadn't encountered before in scientific circles." <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/74.64.96.71" title="Special:Contributions/74.64.96.71">74.64.96.71</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:74.64.96.71" title="User talk:74.64.96.71">talk</a>) 10:26, 14 October 2010 (UTC)</p>

<p>It’s a shame that Wikipedia is letting anyone come in anonymously with a blanket accusation about copyright infringement without even bothering to tell exactly where in the text the copyright was being infringed, so that people could take immediate action and fix the problem.</p>
<p>The gene expression programming article is a big one and it was written specially for Wikipedia. So saying that it infringes copyright without saying exactly where, can only be perceived as intending to paralyze and disrupt. And since Wikipedia is letting anyone come in anonymously and close a page that took great effort and dedication to write, I don’t think we are encouraging the people who are contributing constructively to Wikipedia, on the contrary.</p>
