<h1>Summary of Inheritance</h1>
<p>Except for the <code>Object</code> class, a class has exactly one direct superclass. A class inherits fields and methods from all its superclasses, whether direct or indirect. A subclass can override methods that it inherits, or it can hide fields or methods that it inherits. (Note that hiding fields is generally bad programming practice.)</p>
<p>The table in 
<a class="TutorialLink" target="_top" href="override.html">Overriding and Hiding Methods</a> section shows the effect of declaring a method with the same signature as a method in the superclass.</p>
<p>The <code>Object</code> class is the top of the class hierarchy. All classes are descendants from this class and inherit methods from it. Useful methods inherited from <code>Object</code> include <code>toString()</code>, <code>equals()</code>, <code>clone()</code>, and <code>getClass()</code>.</p>
<p>You can prevent a class from being subclassed by using the <code>final</code> keyword in the class's declaration. Similarly, you can prevent a method from being overridden by subclasses by declaring it as a final method.</p>
<p>An abstract class can only be subclassed; it cannot be instantiated. An abstract class can contain abstract methodsÂ—methods that are declared but not implemented. Subclasses then provide the implementations for the abstract methods.</p>
