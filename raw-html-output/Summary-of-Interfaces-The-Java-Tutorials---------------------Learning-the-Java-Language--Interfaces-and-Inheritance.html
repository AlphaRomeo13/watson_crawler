<h1>Summary of Interfaces</h1>
<p>An interface declaration can contain method signatures, default methods, static methods and constant definitions. The only methods that have implementations are default and static methods.</p>
<p>A class that implements an interface must implement all the methods declared in the interface.</p>
<p>An interface name can be used anywhere a type can be used.</p>
