<p>In <a href="/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" title="Object-oriented programming">object-oriented programming (OOP)</a>, an <b>instance</b> is a specific realization of any <a href="/wiki/Object_(computer_science)" title="Object (computer science)">object</a>. Formally "instance" is synonymous with "object", as they are each a particular value (realization), and these may be called an <b>instance object</b>; "instance" emphasizes the distinct identity of the object. The creation of a realized instance is called <a href="/wiki/Instantiation" title="Instantiation" class="mw-disambig">instantiation</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Class-based_programming" title="Class-based programming">class-based programming</a>, objects are created from <a href="/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)" title="Class (computer programming)">classes</a> by <a href="/wiki/Subroutine" title="Subroutine">subroutines</a> called <a href="/wiki/Constructor_(object-oriented_programming)" title="Constructor (object-oriented programming)">constructors</a>, and destroyed by <a href="/wiki/Destructor_(computer_programming)" title="Destructor (computer programming)">destructors</a>. An object is an instance of a class, and may be called a <b>class instance</b> or <b>class object</b>; instantiation is then also known as construction. Not all classes can be instantiated –  <a href="/wiki/Abstract_class" title="Abstract class" class="mw-redirect">abstract classes</a> cannot be instantiated, while classes that can be instantiated are called <a href="/wiki/Concrete_class" title="Concrete class" class="mw-redirect">concrete classes</a>. In <a href="/wiki/Prototype-based_programming" title="Prototype-based programming">prototype-based programming</a>, instantiation is instead done by copying a prototype.</p>
<p>An object may be varied in a number of ways. Each realized variation of that object is an instance. Each time a <a href="/wiki/Computer_program" title="Computer program">program</a> runs, it is an instance of that program. That is, it is a member of a given class that has specified <a href="/wiki/Value_(computer_science)" title="Value (computer science)">values</a> rather than <a href="/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)" title="Variable (computer science)">variables</a>. In a non-programming context, you could think of "dog" as a type and your particular dog as an instance of that class.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>An important distinction is between <a href="/wiki/Data_type" title="Data type">data type</a> (interface) and <a href="/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)" title="Class (computer programming)">class</a> (implementation).</p>
<p>The meaning of the term <i>type</i> in computer science is similar to the meaning of the word "type" in everyday language. For example, a barman can ask a client, what type of beverage does he/she want? Coffee, tea, beer? A particular cup of coffee that the client receives is in the role of an instance. Two cups of coffee would form a set of two instances of (the type) coffee.</p>
