<h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading" lang="en"><span dir="auto">Spaghetti code</span></h1>
<p><b>Spaghetti code</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Pejorative" title="Pejorative">pejorative</a> term for <a href="/wiki/Source_code" title="Source code">source code</a> that has a complex and tangled <a href="/wiki/Control_structure" title="Control structure" class="mw-redirect">control structure</a>, especially one using many <a href="/wiki/Goto" title="Goto">GOTO</a> statements, exceptions, threads, or other "<a href="/wiki/Unstructured_programming" title="Unstructured programming" class="mw-redirect">unstructured</a>" <a href="/wiki/Branch_(computer_science)" title="Branch (computer science)">branching</a> constructs. It is named such because program flow is conceptually like a bowl of spaghetti, i.e. twisted and tangled. Spaghetti code can be caused by several factors, including inexperienced programmers blindly obeying their supervisors' mandates on how to write code and a complex program which has been continuously modified by several people over a long life cycle. <a href="/wiki/Structured_programming" title="Structured programming">Structured programming</a> greatly decreases the incidence of spaghetti code.</p>

<p>In the 1978 book <i>A primer on disciplined programming using PL/I, PL/CS, and PL/CT</i>, Richard Conway used the term to describe types of programs that "have the same clean logical structure as a plate of spaghetti",<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> a phrase repeated in the 1979 book <i>An Introduction to Programming</i> he co-authored with <a href="/wiki/David_Gries" title="David Gries">David Gries</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> In the 1988 paper <i>A spiral model of software development and enhancement</i>, the term is used to describe the older practice of the <i>code and fix model</i>, which lacked planning and eventually led to the development of the <a href="/wiki/Waterfall_model" title="Waterfall model">waterfall model</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> In the 1979 book <i>Structured programming for the COBOL programmer</i>, author Paul Noll uses the terms <i>spaghetti code</i> and <i>rat's nest</i> as synonyms to describe poorly structured source code.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In a 1980 publication by the <a href="/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology" title="National Institute of Standards and Technology">United States National Bureau of Standards</a>, the term <b>spaghetti program</b> was used to describe older programs having "fragmented and scattered files".<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> The consequences of using <code>goto</code> statements in programs were described in a 1980 paper, which stated that it was perceived to be "evil".<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In the <i>Ada – Europe '93</i> conference, <a href="/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)" title="Ada (programming language)">Ada</a> was described as forcing the programmer to "produce understandable, instead of spaghetti code", because of its restrictive exception propagation mechanism.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In a 1981 computer languages spoof in <i>The Michigan Technic</i> titled "BASICally speaking...FORTRAN bytes!!", the author described <a href="/wiki/FORTRAN" title="FORTRAN" class="mw-redirect">FORTRAN</a> as "proof positive that the cofounders of <a href="/wiki/International_Business_Machines" title="International Business Machines" class="mw-redirect">IBM</a> were Italian, for it consists entirely of spaghetti code".<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Below is what would be considered a trivial example of spaghetti code in <a href="/wiki/BASIC_programming_language" title="BASIC programming language" class="mw-redirect">BASIC</a>. The program prints each of the numbers 1 to 10 to the screen along with its square. Notice that indentation is not used to differentiate the various actions performed by the code, and that the program's <code><a href="/wiki/Goto" title="Goto">GOTO</a></code> statements create a reliance on <a href="/wiki/Line_number" title="Line number">line numbers</a>. Also observe the less easily predictable way the flow of execution jumps from one area to another. Real-world occurrences of spaghetti code are more complex and can add greatly to a program's maintenance costs.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Assembly_and_script_languages">Assembly and script languages</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Spaghetti_code&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Assembly and script languages">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>When using the many forms of <a href="/wiki/Assembly_language" title="Assembly language">assembly language</a> (and also the underlying <a href="/wiki/Machine_code" title="Machine code">machine code</a>) the danger of writing spaghetti code is especially great. This is because they are <a href="/wiki/Low-level_programming_language" title="Low-level programming language">low-level programming languages</a> where equivalents for structured control flow statements such as <a href="/wiki/For_loop" title="For loop">for loops</a> and <a href="/wiki/While_loop" title="While loop">while loops</a> exist, but are often poorly understood by inexperienced programmers. Many scripting languages have the same deficiencies: this applies to the batch scripting language of <a href="/wiki/DOS" title="DOS">DOS</a> and <a href="/wiki/DIGITAL_Command_Language" title="DIGITAL Command Language">DCL</a> on <a href="/wiki/OpenVMS" title="OpenVMS">VMS</a>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, adopting the same discipline as in <a href="/wiki/Structured_programming" title="Structured programming">structured programming</a> can greatly improve the readability and maintainability of such code. This may take the form of conventions limiting the use of <code>goto</code> to correspond to the standard structures, or use of a set of assembler macros for <code>if</code> and <code>loop</code> constructs. Most assembly languages also provide a <a href="/wiki/Function_stack" title="Function stack" class="mw-redirect">function stack</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Subroutine" title="Subroutine">function</a> call mechanisms which can be used to gain the advantages of <a href="/wiki/Procedural_programming" title="Procedural programming">procedural programming</a>. Macros can again be used to support a standardized form of parameter passing, to avoid ad hoc <a href="/wiki/Global_variable" title="Global variable">global variables</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Action_at_a_distance_(computer_science)" title="Action at a distance (computer science)" class="mw-redirect">action at a distance</a> <a href="/wiki/Anti-pattern" title="Anti-pattern">anti-pattern</a>.</p>
<p>Programs written in <a href="/wiki/High-level_programming_language" title="High-level programming language">higher-level languages</a> with high-level constructs such as <i>for loops</i> (as in the second example above) are often compiled into assembly or machine code. When this process occurs, the high-level constructs are translated into low-level "spaghetti code" which may resemble the first example above in terms of control flow. But because compilers must be faithful to high-level constructs in the source code, the problems that plague relatively unstructured languages like BASIC do not haunt higher-level languages. It does, however, mean that debugging even mildly optimized code with a source-level debugger can be surprisingly confusing.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ravioli_code">Ravioli code</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Spaghetti_code&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: Ravioli code">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Ravioli code is a type of computer program structure, characterized by a number of very small and (ideally) <a href="/wiki/Loose_coupling" title="Loose coupling">loosely coupled</a> <a href="/wiki/Software_component" title="Software component" class="mw-redirect">software components</a>. The term stems from the analogy of <a href="/wiki/Ravioli" title="Ravioli">ravioli</a> (small pasta pouches containing cheese, meat, or vegetables) to modules (which ideally are encapsulated, consisting of both code and data). While generally desirable from a coupling and cohesion perspective, overzealous separation and encapsulation of code can bloat call stacks and make navigation through the code for maintenance purposes more difficult.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Lasagna_code">Lasagna code</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Spaghetti_code&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: Lasagna code">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Lasagna code, a term coined in 1982 by <a href="/wiki/Joe_Celko" title="Joe Celko">Joe Celko</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> refers to a type of program structure characterized by several <a href="/wiki/Architectural_layer" title="Architectural layer" class="mw-redirect">well-defined and separable <i>layers</i></a>, where each layer of code accesses services in the layers below through well-defined <a href="/wiki/Interface_(computer_science)" title="Interface (computer science)" class="mw-redirect">interfaces</a>. The analogy stems from the layered structure of <a href="/wiki/Lasagna" title="Lasagna" class="mw-redirect">lasagna</a>, where different ingredients (for example, meat, sauce, vegetables, or cheese) are each separated by strips of pasta. Also known as "onion code" because one often cries when opening so many layers.</p>
<p>One common instance of lasagna code occurs at the interface between different subsystems, such as between web application code, <a href="/wiki/Business_logic" title="Business logic">business logic</a>, and a <a href="/wiki/Relational_database" title="Relational database">relational database</a>. Another common programming technique, alternate hard and soft layers (use of different <a href="/wiki/Programming_language" title="Programming language">programming languages</a> at different levels of the program architecture), tends to produce lasagna code. In general, <a href="/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server" title="Client–server" class="mw-redirect">client–server</a> applications are frequently lasagna code, with well-defined interfaces between client and server.</p>
<p>Lasagna code generally enforces <a href="/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_science)" title="Encapsulation (computer science)" class="mw-redirect">encapsulation</a> between the different "layers", as the subsystems in question may have no means of communication other than through a well-defined mechanism, such as <a href="/wiki/Structured_Query_Language" title="Structured Query Language" class="mw-redirect">Structured Query Language</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Foreign_function_interface" title="Foreign function interface">foreign function interface</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Remote_procedure_call" title="Remote procedure call">remote procedure call</a>. However, individual layers in the system may be highly unstructured or disorganized.</p>
<p>A similar layering may be seen in communication stacks, where a protocol (such as the <a href="/wiki/OSI_model" title="OSI model">OSI model</a>) is divided into layers (in this case seven), with each layer performing a limited and well-defined function and communicating with other layers using specific and standardized methods. Such a design eases the evolutionary improvement of the entire stack through layer-specific improvements.</p>
<p>Again, while loosely coupled layering is generally desirable in a program's architecture because it makes objects at each layer more interchangeable with existing or possible future implementations, other types of changes to the code will actually increase in complexity as more layers are added and so an extensively layered architecture can be seen as an <a href="/wiki/Anti-pattern" title="Anti-pattern">anti-pattern</a> as well. Adding a new field to a UI view, for example, requires changing every object at every layer in the architecture that is required to have knowledge about this new field (generally the view itself, any underlying controller/presenter class, data transfer objects, SOA layers, data access objects or mappings, and the database schema itself). A quote usually attributed either to <a href="/wiki/David_Wheeler_(computer_scientist)" title="David Wheeler (computer scientist)" class="mw-redirect">David Wheeler</a> or <a href="/wiki/Butler_Lampson" title="Butler Lampson">Butler Lampson</a> reads, "There is no problem in computer science that cannot be solved by adding another layer of indirection, <i>except</i> having too many layers of indirection".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spaghetti_with_meatballs">Spaghetti with meatballs</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Spaghetti_code&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7" title="Edit section: Spaghetti with meatballs">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>The term "spaghetti with meatballs" is a pejorative term used in computer science to describe loosely constructed <a href="/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" title="Object-oriented programming">object-oriented programming</a> (OOP) that remains dependent on procedural code. It may be the result of a system whose development has included a long life cycle, language constraints, <a href="/wiki/Program_optimization" title="Program optimization">micro-optimization</a> theatre, or a lack of coherent <a href="/wiki/Programming_style" title="Programming style">coding standards</a>.</p>
<p>In some languages, OOP features are available only in later specifications. Notable examples of this include <a href="/wiki/Visual_Basic" title="Visual Basic">Visual Basic</a> and <a href="/wiki/PHP" title="PHP">PHP</a>. Other languages, such as <a href="/wiki/C_(programming_language)" title="C (programming language)">C</a>, rely on <a href="/wiki/Function_pointer" title="Function pointer">function pointers</a> to simulate OOP — still requiring the underlying procedural code to which they point.</p>
<p>Using OOP does not necessarily prevent a class's code from becoming spaghetti-like. In this parlance, "spaghetti" describes twisted, tangled and unstructured code, while "meatballs" denotes the use of class structures (i.e. objects).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Macaroni_code">Macaroni code</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Spaghetti_code&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Macaroni code">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>By analogy to <a href="/wiki/Macaronic_language" title="Macaronic language">macaronic language</a>, macaroni code mixes two or more computer languages together in a single document. Common examples include embedding <a href="/wiki/Regular_expression" title="Regular expression">regular expressions</a> (regexes) or <a href="/wiki/SQL" title="SQL">SQL</a> queries in a programming language, and embedding <a href="/wiki/CSS" title="CSS" class="mw-redirect">CSS</a> or <a href="/wiki/JavaScript" title="JavaScript">JavaScript</a> in HTML – or conversely HTML fragments in JavaScript. Particularly complex examples occur in <a href="/wiki/Server-side_scripting" title="Server-side scripting">server-side scripting</a> languages such as <a href="/wiki/Active_Server_Pages" title="Active Server Pages">Active Server Pages</a> and <a href="/wiki/PHP" title="PHP">PHP</a>, which are explicitly intended to be embedded in HTML code – the HTML may then contain CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, while the JavaScript may itself contain HTML and PHP (potentially recursively), and the PHP may contain regexes and SQL. In these cases it is not difficult to use four or more languages in a single document, as shown in the "Hello World" example below:</p>
<p>The above example<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> uses SQL within PHP, PHP within HTML, PHP within JavaScript, and Javascript within HTML (overall HTML, with HTML containing PHP containing SQL, and HTML containing JavaScript containing PHP).</p>
<p>Because macaroni code can be difficult to read and maintain, particularly for people who do not know all of the languages used, open-source projects frequently take pains to isolate the various languages from each other in separate files.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (October 2014)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> The above example could be rewritten as four separate files (.html and .js sent to the browser and .php and .sql remaining on the server), but the JavaScript would need to send an <a href="/wiki/AJAX" title="AJAX" class="mw-redirect">AJAX</a> request to the PHP script to retrieve the values of the two variables it needs to complete the page. Loading the page would thus require three HTTP requests (for the .html, .js, and AJAX) instead of just one for the file of macaroni code.</p>
