<h1>The Security Manager</h1>
<p>A <i>security manager</i> is an object that defines a security policy for an application. This policy specifies actions that are unsafe or sensitive. Any actions not allowed by the security policy cause a 
<a class="APILink" target="_blank" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/SecurityException.html"><code>SecurityException</code></a> to be thrown. An application can also query its security manager to discover which actions are allowed.</p>
<p>Typically, a web applet runs with a security manager provided by the browser or Java Web Start plugin. Other kinds of applications normally run without a security manager, unless the application itself defines one. If no security manager is present, the application has no security policy and acts without restrictions.</p>
<p>This section explains how an application interacts with an existing security manager. For more detailed information, including information on how to design a security manager, refer to the

<h2>Interacting with the Security Manager</h2>
<p>The security manager is an object of type 
<a class="APILink" target="_blank" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/SecurityManager.html"><code>SecurityManager</code></a>; to obtain a reference to this object, invoke <code>System.getSecurityManager</code>.</p>
<p>WHATSON? dc7091b1-e859-4fdb-83c7-155315d5bd41</p>
<pre>
SecurityManager appsm = System.getSecurityManager();
</pre>
<p>If there is no security manager, this method returns <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>Once an application has a reference to the security manager object, it can request permission to do specific things. Many classes in the standard libraries do this. For example, <code>System.exit</code>, which terminates the Java virtual machine with an exit status, invokes <code>SecurityManager.checkExit</code> to ensure that the current thread has permission to shut down the application.</p>
<p>The SecurityManager class defines many other methods used to verify other kinds of operations. For example, <code>SecurityManager.checkAccess</code> verifies thread accesses, and <code>SecurityManager.checkPropertyAccess</code> verifies access to the specified property. Each operation or group of operations has its own <code>check<em>XXX</em>()</code> method.</p>
<p>In addition, the set of <code>check<em>XXX</em>()</code> methods represents the set of operations that are already subject to the protection of the security manager. Typically, an application does not have to directly invoke any <code>check<em>XXX</em>()</code> methods.</p>
<h2>Recognizing a Security Violation</h2>
<p>Many actions that are routine without a security manager can throw a <code>SecurityException</code> when run with a security manager. This is true even when invoking a method that isn't documented as throwing <code>SecurityException</code>. For example, consider the following code used to read a file:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 0de0723b-a1d1-4aa4-890f-4883f896cb09</p>
<pre>
reader = new FileReader("xanadu.txt");
</pre>
<p>In the absence of a security manager, this statement executes without error, provided <code>xanadu.txt</code> exists and is readable. But suppose this statement is inserted in a web applet, which typically runs under a security manager that does not allow file input. The following error messages might result:</p>
