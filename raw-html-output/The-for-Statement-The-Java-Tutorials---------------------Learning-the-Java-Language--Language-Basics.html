<h1>The for Statement</h1>
<p>The <code>for</code> statement provides a compact way to iterate over a range of values. Programmers often refer to it as the "for loop" because of the way in which it repeatedly loops until a particular condition is satisfied. The general form of the <code>for</code> statement can be expressed as follows:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 0ac952fb-cf85-4674-99ca-16276479648f</p>
<pre>
for (<em>initialization</em>; <em>termination</em>;
     <em>increment</em>) {
    <em>statement(s)</em>
}
</pre>
<p>When using this version of the <code>for</code> statement, keep in mind that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>initialization</em> expression initializes the loop; it's executed once, as the loop begins.</li>
<li>When the <em>termination</em> expression evaluates to <code>false</code>, the loop terminates.</li>
<li>The <em>increment</em> expression is invoked after each iteration through the loop; it is perfectly acceptable for this expression to increment <i>or</i> decrement a value.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following program, 
<a class="SourceLink" target="_blank" href="examples/ForDemo.java" onclick="showCode('../../displayCode.html', 'examples/ForDemo.java'); return false;"><code>ForDemo</code></a>, uses the general form of the <code>for</code> statement to print the numbers 1 through 10 to standard output:</p>
<p>WHATSON? d735e63f-600b-468b-a2d9-49c46a83dfe0</p>
<pre>

class ForDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args){
         for(int i=1; i&lt;11; i++){
              System.out.println("Count is: " + i);
         }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>The output of this program is:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 01c68279-de53-4219-8dbf-c9a879e989a7</p>
<pre>
Count is: 1
Count is: 2
Count is: 3
Count is: 4
Count is: 5
Count is: 6
Count is: 7
Count is: 8
Count is: 9
Count is: 10
</pre>
<p>Notice how the code declares a variable within the initialization expression. The scope of this variable extends from its declaration to the end of the block governed by the <code>for</code> statement, so it can be used in the termination and increment expressions as well. If the variable that controls a <code>for</code> statement is not needed outside of the loop, it's best to declare the variable in the initialization expression. The names <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, and <code>k</code> are often used to control <code>for</code> loops; declaring them within the initialization expression limits their life span and reduces errors.</p>
<p>The three expressions of the <code>for</code> loop are optional; an infinite loop can be created as follows:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 1ddc79fa-6f2c-4eba-8616-e7ea0f556d5b</p>
<pre>
// infinite loop
for ( ; ; ) {
    
    // your code goes here
}
</pre>
<p>The <code>for</code> statement also has another form designed for iteration through 
<a class="TutorialLink" target="_top" href="../../collections/index.html">Collections</a> and 
<a class="TutorialLink" target="_top" href="arrays.html">arrays</a> This form is sometimes referred to as the <i>enhanced for</i> statement, and can be used to make your loops more compact and easy to read. To demonstrate, consider the following array, which holds the numbers 1 through 10:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 3b25d512-062b-4210-b3ea-2e68734406a6</p>
<pre>
int[] numbers = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};
</pre>
<p>The following program, 
<a class="SourceLink" target="_blank" href="examples/EnhancedForDemo.java" onclick="showCode('../../displayCode.html', 'examples/EnhancedForDemo.java'); return false;"><code>EnhancedForDemo</code></a>, uses the enhanced <code>for</code> to loop through the array:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 5d909a79-283b-4fb6-9c16-b31bf976ddbe</p>
<pre>

class EnhancedForDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args){
         int[] numbers = 
             {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};
         for (int item : numbers) {
             System.out.println("Count is: " + item);
         }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>In this example, the variable <code>item</code> holds the current value from the numbers array. The output from this program is the same as before:</p>
<p>WHATSON? c43182aa-e78a-4afe-ba18-9dc1b1354031</p>
<pre>
Count is: 1
Count is: 2
Count is: 3
Count is: 4
Count is: 5
Count is: 6
Count is: 7
Count is: 8
Count is: 9
Count is: 10
</pre>
<p>We recommend using this form of the <code>for</code> statement instead of the general form whenever possible.</p>
