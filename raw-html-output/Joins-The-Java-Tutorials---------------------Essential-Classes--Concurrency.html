<h1>Joins</h1>
<p>The <code>join</code> method allows one thread to wait for the completion of another. If <code>t</code> is a <code>Thread</code> object whose thread is currently executing,</p>
<p>WHATSON? 2fca23cf-c420-4429-9d0b-0795a840b69c</p>
<pre>
t.join();
</pre>
<p>causes the current thread to pause execution until <code>t</code>'s thread terminates. Overloads of <code>join</code> allow the programmer to specify a waiting period. However, as with <code>sleep</code>, <code>join</code> is dependent on the OS for timing, so you should not assume that <code>join</code> will wait exactly as long as you specify.</p>
<p>Like <code>sleep</code>, <code>join</code> responds to an interrupt by exiting with an <code>InterruptedException</code>.</p>
