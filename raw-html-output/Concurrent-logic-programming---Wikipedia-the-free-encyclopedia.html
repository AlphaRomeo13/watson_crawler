<p><b>Concurrent logic programming</b> is a variant of <a href="/wiki/Logic_programming" title="Logic programming">logic programming</a> in which programs are sets of guarded <a href="/wiki/Horn_clauses" title="Horn clauses" class="mw-redirect">Horn clauses</a> of the form:</p>
<p>The conjunction <tt>G<sub>1</sub>, … , G<sub>n</sub></tt> is called the <a href="/wiki/Guard_(computing)" title="Guard (computing)" class="mw-redirect">guard</a> of the clause, and <tt>|</tt> is the commitment operator.</p>
<p>Declaratively, guarded Horn clauses are read as ordinary logical implications:</p>
<p>However, procedurally, when there are several clauses whose heads <tt>H</tt> match a given goal, then all of the clauses are executed in parallel, checking whether their guards <tt>G<sub>1</sub>, … , G<sub>n</sub></tt> hold. If the guards of more than one clause hold, then a committed choice is made to one of the clauses, and execution proceedes with the subgoals <tt>B<sub>1</sub>, …, B<sub>n</sub></tt> of the chosen clause. These subgoals can also be executed in parallel. Thus concurrent logic programming implements a form of "don't care nondeterminism", rather than "don't know nondeterminism".</p>

<p>The first concurrent logic programming language was the Relational Language of Clark and Gregory, which was an offshoot of IC-Prolog. Later versions of concurrent logic programming include Shapiro's Concurrent Prolog and Ueda's Guarded Horn Clause language GHC.</p>
<p>The development of concurrent logic programming was given an impetus when GHC was used to implement KL1, the systems programming language of the <a href="/wiki/Fifth_generation_computer" title="Fifth generation computer">Japanese Fifth Generation Project (FGCS)</a>. The FGCS Project was a $400M initiative by Japan's <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_International_Trade_and_Industry" title="Ministry of International Trade and Industry">Ministry of International Trade and Industry</a>, begun in 1982, to use massively parallel computing/processing for artificial intelligence applications. The choice of concurrent logic programming as the “missing link” between the hardware and the applications was influenced by a visit to the FGCS Project in 1982 by <a href="/wiki/Ehud_Shapiro" title="Ehud Shapiro">Ehud Shapiro</a>, who invented Concurrent Prolog.</p>
