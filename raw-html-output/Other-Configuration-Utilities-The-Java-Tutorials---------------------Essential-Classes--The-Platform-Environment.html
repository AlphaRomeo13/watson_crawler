<h1>Other Configuration Utilities</h1>
<p>Here is a summary of some other configuration utilities.</p>
<p>The <i>Preferences API</i> allows applications to store and retrieve configuration data in an implementation-dependent backing store. Asynchronous updates are supported, and the same set of preferences can be safely updated by multiple threads and even multiple applications. For more information, refer to the 
<a class="OutsideLink" target="_blank" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/preferences/index.html">Preferences API Guide</a>.</p>
<p>An application deployed in a <i>JAR archive</i> uses a <i>manifest</i> to describe the contents of the archive. For more information, refer to the 
<a class="TutorialLink" target="_top" href="../../deployment/jar/index.html">Packaging Programs in JAR Files</a> lesson.</p>
<p>The configuration of a <i>Java Web Start application</i> is contained in a <i>JNLP file</i>. For more information, refer to the 
<a class="TutorialLink" target="_top" href="../../deployment/webstart/index.html">Java Web Start</a> lesson.</p>
<p>The configuration of a <i>Java Plug-in applet</i> is partially determined by the HTML tags used to embed the applet in the web page. Depending on the applet and the browser, these tags can include <code>&lt;applet&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;object&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;param&gt;</code>. For more information, refer to the 
<a class="TutorialLink" target="_top" href="../../deployment/applet/index.html">Java Applets</a> lesson.</p>
<p>The class 
<a class="APILink" target="_blank" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html"><code>java.util.ServiceLoader</code></a> provides a simple <i>service provider</i> facility. A service provider is an implementation of a <i>service</i> Â— a well-known set of interfaces and (usually abstract) classes. The classes in a service provider typically implement the interfaces and subclass the classes defined in the service. Service providers can be installed as extensions (see 
<a class="TutorialLink" target="_top" href="../../ext/index.html">The Extension Mechanism</a>). Providers can also be made available by adding them to the class path or by some other platform-specific means.</p>
