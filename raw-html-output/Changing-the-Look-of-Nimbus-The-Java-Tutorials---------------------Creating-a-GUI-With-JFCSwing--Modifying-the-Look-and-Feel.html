<li>
<a class="TutorialLink" target="_top" href="color.html">Changing the color theme</a> – You can change any of the colors used in the Nimbus look and feel.</li>
<li>Skinning a component – You have full control over how a component is rendered. Skinning, or customizing the look of, a component is beyond the scope of this tutorial. See
