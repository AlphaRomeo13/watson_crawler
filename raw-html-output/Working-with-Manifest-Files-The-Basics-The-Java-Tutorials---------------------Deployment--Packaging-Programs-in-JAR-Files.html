<h1>Working with Manifest Files: The Basics</h1>
<p>JAR files support a wide range of functionality, including electronic signing, version control, package sealing, and others. What gives a JAR file this versatility? The answer is the JAR file's <em>manifest</em>.</p>
<p>The manifest is a special file that can contain information about the files packaged in a JAR file. By tailoring this "meta" information that the manifest contains, you enable the JAR file to serve a variety of purposes.</p>
<p>This lesson will explain the contents of the manifest file and show you how to work with it, with examples for the basic features:</p>
