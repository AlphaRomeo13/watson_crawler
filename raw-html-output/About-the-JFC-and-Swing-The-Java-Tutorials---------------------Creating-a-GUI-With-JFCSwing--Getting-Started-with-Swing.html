<h1>About the JFC and Swing</h1>
<p>JFC is short for Java Foundation Classes, which encompass a group of features for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and adding rich graphics functionality and interactivity to Java applications. It is defined as containing the features shown in the table below.</p>
<p>This trail concentrates on the Swing components. We help you choose the appropriate components for your GUI, tell you how to use them, and give you the background information you need to use them effectively. We also discuss other features as they apply to Swing components.</p>
<h2>Which Swing Packages Should I Use?</h2>
<p>The Swing API is powerful, flexible â€” and immense. The Swing API has 18 public packages:</p>
<p>Fortunately, most programs use only a small subset of the API. This trail sorts out the API for you, giving you examples of common code and pointing you to methods and classes you're likely to need. Most of the code in this trail uses only one or two Swing packages:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>javax.swing</code></li>
<li><code>javax.swing.event</code> (not always required)</li>
</ul>
