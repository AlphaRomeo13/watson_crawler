<h1>Deleting a File or Directory</h1>
<p>You can delete files, directories or links. With symbolic links, the link is deleted and not the target of the link. With directories, the directory must be empty, or the deletion fails.</p>
<p>The <code>Files</code> class provides two deletion methods.</p>
<p>The 
<a class="APILink" target="_blank" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#delete-java.nio.file.Path-"><code>delete(Path)</code></a> method deletes the file or throws an exception if the deletion fails. For example, if the file does not exist a <code>NoSuchFileException</code> is thrown. You can catch the exception to determine why the delete failed as follows:</p>

<pre>
try {
    Files.delete(path);
} catch (NoSuchFileException x) {
    System.err.format("%s: no such" + " file or directory%n", path);
} catch (DirectoryNotEmptyException x) {
    System.err.format("%s not empty%n", path);
} catch (IOException x) {
    // File permission problems are caught here.
    System.err.println(x);
}
</pre>
<p>The 
<a class="APILink" target="_blank" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#deleteIfExists-java.nio.file.Path-"><code>deleteIfExists(Path)</code></a> method also deletes the file, but if the file does not exist, no exception is thrown. Failing silently is useful when you have multiple threads deleting files and you don't want to throw an exception just because one thread did so first.</p>
