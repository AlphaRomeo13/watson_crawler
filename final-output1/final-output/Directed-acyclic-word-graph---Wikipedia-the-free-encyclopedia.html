<h1>Directed acyclic word graph</h1>
<p>In computer science, a <b>directed acyclic word graph</b> (<b>DAWG</b>) is a data structure that represents the set of all substrings of a string. As its name implies, a DAWG takes the form of a directed acyclic graph; it can also be viewed as a deterministic finite automaton, and is similar in structure to suffix trees. DAWG have applications in approximate string matching.</p>
