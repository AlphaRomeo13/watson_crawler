<h1>Shortest common supersequence</h1>
<p>In computer science, the <b>shortest common supersequence problem</b> is a problem closely related to the longest common subsequence problem. Given two sequences <b>X</b> = &lt; x<sub>1</sub>,...,x<sub>m</sub> &gt; and <b>Y</b> = &lt; y<sub>1</sub>,...,y<sub>n</sub> &gt;, a sequence <b>U</b> = &lt; u<sub>1</sub>,...,u<sub>k</sub> &gt; is a common supersequence of <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> if <b>U</b> is a supersequence of both <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b>. In other words, a shortest common supersequence of strings x and y is a shortest string z such that both x and y are subsequences of z.</p>
<p>A shortest common supersequence (scs) is a common supersequence of minimal length. In the shortest common supersequence problem, the two sequences <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> are given and the task is to find a shortest possible common supersequence of these sequences. In general, an scs is not unique.</p>
<p>For two input sequences, an scs can be formed from a longest common subsequence (lcs) easily. For example, if <b>X</b><img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="[1..m] = abcbdab" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/3/6/73691ae55db5efc5c9a31635beac6d40.png"> and <b>Y</b><img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="[1..n] = bdcaba" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/5/9/159953a248cc757802d1301718adb756.png">, the lcs is <b>Z</b><img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="[1..r] = bcba" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/7/9/4792e058bcc4c4d599589192fe83d64f.png">. By inserting the non-lcs symbols while preserving the symbol order, we get the scs: <b>U</b><img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="[1..t] = abdcabdab" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/5/9/b5990d6b088b3832fe8e18b9c85ef07b.png">.</p>
<p>It is quite clear that <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt=" r + t = m + n " src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/5/8/1586b0c40049ca1e48caf2a9c4a59cab.png"> for two input sequences. However, for three or more input sequences this does not hold. Note also, that the lcs and the scs problems are not dual problems.</p>
<p>For the more general problem of finding a string, <b>S</b> which is a superstring of a set of strings <b>S<sub>1</sub></b>,<b>S<sub>2</sub></b>,...,<b>S<sub>l</sub></b>, the problem is NP-Complete . Also, good approximations can be found for the average case but not for the worst case.</p>
