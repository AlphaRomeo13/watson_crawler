<h1>Out-of-core algorithm</h1>
<p><b>Out-of-core</b> or <b>external memory algorithms</b> are algorithms that are designed to process data that is too large to fit into a computer's main memory at one time. Such algorithms must be optimized to efficiently fetch and access data stored in slow bulk memory such as hard drives or tape drives.</p>
<p>A typical example is geographic information systems, especially digital elevation models, where the full data set easily exceeds several gigabytes or even terabytes of data.</p>
<p>This notion naturally extends to a network connecting a data server to a treatment or visualization workstation. Popular mass-of-data based web applications such as google-Map or google-Earth enter this topic.</p>
<p>It also extends to GPU computing - utilizing powerful graphics cards with little memory (compared to CPU memory) and slow CPU-GPU memory transfer (compared to computation bandwidth).</p>
