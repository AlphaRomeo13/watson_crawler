<p>A <b>unary function</b> is a function that takes one argument. In computer science, a unary operator is a subset of unary function.</p>
<p>ExampleÂ :- a++ here a is an operand which is operated by a unary operator++. it can be written in the form a=a+1. Many of the elementary functions are unary functions, in particular the trigonometric functions, logarithm with a pre-specified base, exponentiation to a pre-specified power or from a pre-specified base, and hyperbolic function are unary.</p>
