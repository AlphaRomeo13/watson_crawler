<h1>Ternary operation</h1>
<p>In mathematics, a <b>ternary operation</b> is an <i>n</i>-ary operation with <i>n</i> = 3. A ternary operation on a set A takes any given three elements of A and combines them to form a single element of A. An example of a ternary operation is the product in a heap.</p>
<p>In computer science, a <b>ternary operator</b> (sometimes incorrectly called a <i>tertiary operator</i>) is an operator that takes three arguments. The arguments and result can be of different types. Many programming languages that use C-like syntax feature a ternary operator, <code>?:</code>, which defines a conditional expression. Since this operator is often the only existing ternary operator in the language, it is sometimes simply referred to as "<i>the</i> ternary operator". In some languages, this operator is referred to as "the conditional operator".</p>
