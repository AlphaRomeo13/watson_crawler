<h1>Lotka's law</h1>
<p><b>Lotka's law</b>, named after Alfred J. Lotka, is one of a variety of special applications of Zipf's law. It describes the frequency of publication by authors in any given field. It states that the number of authors making <i>n</i> contributions is about <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="1/n^{a}" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/e/e/4eea6e80e6dfd0f3becb9d309d23c34f.png"> of those making one contribution, where <i>a</i> nearly always equals two. More plainly, the number of authors publishing a certain number of articles is a fixed ratio to the number of authors publishing a single article. As the number of articles published increases, authors producing that many publications become less frequent. There are 1/4 as many authors publishing two articles within a specified time period as there are single-publication authors, 1/9 as many publishing three articles, 1/16 as many publishing four articles, etc. Though the law itself covers many disciplines, the actual ratios involved (as a function of 'a') are very discipline-specific.</p>
<p>The general formula says:</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>where <i>X</i> is the number of publications, <i>Y</i> the relative frequency of authors with <i>X</i> publications, and <i>n</i> and <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="C" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/d/6/0d61f8370cad1d412f80b84d143e1257.png"> are constants depending on the specific field (<img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="n \approx 2" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/d/0/5d0b9613e4345c1dead0509df71ec868.png">).</p>
<p>This law is believed to have applications in other fields, for example in the military for fighter pilot kills.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Say 100 authors write one article each over a specific period, we assume for this table that C=1 and n=2:</p>
<p>That would be a total of 293 articles with 155 writers with an average of 1.9 articles for each writer.</p>
<p>This is an empirical observation rather than a necessary result. This form of the law is as originally published and is sometimes referred to as the "discrete Lotka power function".</p>
