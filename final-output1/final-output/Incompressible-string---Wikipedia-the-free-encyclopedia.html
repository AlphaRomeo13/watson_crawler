<h1>Incompressible string</h1>
<p>An <b>incompressible string</b> is one that cannot be compressed because it lacks sufficient repeating sequences. Whether a string is compressible will often depend on the algorithm being used. Some strings are incompressible by any algorithm â€” see Kolmogorov complexity.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Suppose we have the string 12349999123499991234, and we are using a compression method that works by putting a special character into the string (say '@') followed by a value that points to an entry in a lookup table (or dictionary) of repeating values. Let's imagine we have an algorithm that examines the string in 4 character chunks. Looking at our string, our algorithm might pick out the values 1234 and 9999 to place into its dictionary. Let's say 1234 is entry 0 and 9999 is entry 1. Now the string can become:</p>
<p>@0@1@0@1@0</p>
<p>Obviously, this is much shorter, although storing the dictionary itself will cost some space. However, the more repeats there are in the string, the better the compression will be.</p>
<p>Our algorithm can do better though, if it can view the string in chunks larger than 4 characters. Then it can put 12349999 and 1234 into the dictionary, giving us:</p>
<p>@0@0@1</p>
<p>Even shorter. Now let's consider another string:</p>
<p>1234999988884321</p>
<p>This string is incompressible by our algorithm. The only repeats that occur are 88 and 99. If we were to store 88 and 99 in our dictionary, we would produce:</p>
<p>1234@1@1@0@04321</p>
<p>Unfortunately this is just as long as the original string, because our placeholders for items in the dictionary are 2 characters long, and the items they replace are the same length. Hence, this string is incompressible by our algorithm.</p>
