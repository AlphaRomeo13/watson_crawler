<h1>Arborescence (graph theory)</h1>
<p>In graph theory, an <b>arborescence</b> is a directed graph in which, for a vertex <i>u</i> called the root and any other vertex <i>v</i>, there is exactly one directed path from <i>u</i> to <i>v</i>. An arborescence is thus the directed-graph form of a rooted tree, understood here as an undirected graph.</p>
<p>Equivalently, an arborescence is a directed, rooted tree in which all edges point away from the root; a number of other equivalent characterization exist. Every arborescence is a directed acyclic graph (DAG), but not every DAG is an arborescence.</p>
<p>An arborescence can equivalently be defined as a rooted digraph in which the path from the root to any other vertex is unique.</p>
<p>The term <i>arborescence</i> comes from French. Some authors object to it on grounds that it is cumbersome to spell. There is a large number of synonyms for arborescence in graph theory, including <b>directed rooted tree</b> <b>out-arborescence</b>, <b>out-tree</b>, and even <b>branching</b> being used to denote the same concept. <i>Rooted tree</i> itself has been defined by some authors as a directed graph.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some authors define arborescence as to be a spanning directed tree of a given digraph. The same can be said about some its synonyms, especially <i>branching</i>. Other authors use <i>branching</i> to denote a forest of arborescences, with the latter notion defined in broader sense given at beginning of this article, but a variation with both notions of the spanning flavor is also encountered.</p>
<p>It's also possible to define a useful notion by reversing all the arcs the arborescence, i.e. making them all point to the root rather than away from it. Such digraphs are also designated by a variety of terms such as <b>in-tree</b> or <b>anti-arborescence</b> etc. W. T. Tutte distinguishes between the two cases by using the phrases <i>arborescence diverging from</i> [some root] and <i>arborescence converging to</i> [some root].</p>
<p>The number of rooted trees (or arborescences) with <i>n</i> nodes is given by the sequence:</p>
