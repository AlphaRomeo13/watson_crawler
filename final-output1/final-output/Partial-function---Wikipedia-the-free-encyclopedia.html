<h1>Partial function</h1>

</ul>
<p>In mathematics, a <b>partial function</b> from <i>X</i> to <i>Y</i> (written as <i>f</i>: <i>X</i> ↛ <i>Y</i>) is a function <i>f</i>: <i>X'</i> → <i>Y</i>, for some subset <i>X'</i> of <i>X</i>. It generalizes the concept of a function <i>f</i>: <i>X</i> → <i>Y</i> by not forcing <i>f</i> to map <i>every</i> element of <i>X</i> to an element of <i>Y</i> (only some subset <i>X'</i> of <i>X</i>). If <i>X'</i> = <i>X</i>, then <i>f</i> is called a <b>total function</b> and is equivalent to a function. Partial functions are often used when the exact domain, <i>X'</i>, is not known (e.g. many functions in computability theory).</p>
<p>Specifically, we will say that for any <i>x</i> ∈ <i>X</i>, either:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) = <i>y</i> ∈ <i>Y</i> (it is defined as a single element in <i>Y</i>) or</li>
<li><i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) is undefined.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example we can consider the square root function restricted to the integers</p>
<p>Thus <i>g</i>(<i>n</i>) is only defined for <i>n</i> that are perfect squares (i.e. 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...). So, <i>g</i>(25) = 5, but <i>g</i>(26) is undefined.</p>

<h2>Basic concepts</h2>
<p>There are two distinct meanings in current mathematical usage for the notion of the domain of a partial function. Most mathematicians, including recursion theorists, use the term "domain of <i>f</i>" for the set of all values <i>x</i> such that <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) is defined (<i>X'</i> above). But some, particularly category theorists, consider the domain of a partial function <i>f</i>:<i>X</i> → <i>Y</i> to be <i>X</i>, and refer to <i>X'</i> as the <b>domain of definition</b>. Similarly, the term range can refer to either the codomain or the <i>image</i> of a function.</p>
<p>Occasionally, a partial function with domain <i>X</i> and codomain <i>Y</i> is written as <i>f</i>: <i>X</i> ⇸ <i>Y</i>, using an arrow with vertical stroke.</p>
<p>A partial function is said to be injective or surjective when the total function given by the restriction of the partial function to its domain of definition is. A partial function may be both injective and surjective.</p>
<p>Because a function is trivially surjective when restricted to its image, the term partial bijection denotes a partial function which is injective.</p>
<p>An injective partial function may be inverted to an injective partial function, and a partial function which is both injective and surjective has an injective function as inverse. Furthermore, a total function which is injective may be inverted to an injective partial function.</p>
<p>The notion of transformation generalized to partial functions as well. A <b>partial transformation</b> is a function <i>f</i>: <i>A</i> → <i>B</i>, where both <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are subsets of some set <i>X</i>.</p>
<h2>Total function</h2>
<p>Total function is a synonym for function. The use of the prefix "total" is to suggest that it is a special case of a partial function. For example, when considering the operation of morphism composition in Concrete Categories, the composition operation <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="\circ : \operatorname{Hom}(C) \times \operatorname{Hom}(C) \to \operatorname{Hom}(C)" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/5/5/855a41c156ff83d5f407dd3d0002402e.png"> is a total function if and only if <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="\operatorname{Ob}(C)" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/4/1/0418299e8b24b1ebd0eb115b887ea1b3.png"> has one element. The reason for this is that two morphisms <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="f:X\to Y" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/2/d/52d50404f827bbeee59ac8a21a1378b5.png"> and <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="g:U\to V" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/3/1/2312318a3d6f0523ddeb199d81b979c2.png"> can only be composed as <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="g \circ f" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/5/a/a5a0406f40aa56d878c3c55c0f019d58.png"> if <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="Y=U" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/7/8/2789c618b572916756f8a7efde45ef76.png">, that is, the codomain of <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="f" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/f/a/8fa14cdd754f91cc6554c9e71929cce7.png"> must equal the domain of <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="g" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/2/f/b2f5ff47436671b6e533d8dc3614845d.png">.</p>
<h2>Discussion and examples</h2>
<p>The first diagram above represents a partial function that is <b>not</b> a total function since the element 1 in the left-hand set is not associated with anything in the right-hand set. Whereas, the second diagram represents a total function since every element on the left-hand set is associated with exactly one element in the right hand set.</p>
<h3>Natural logarithm</h3>
<p>Consider the natural logarithm function mapping the real numbers to themselves. The logarithm of a non-positive real is not a real number, so the natural logarithm function doesn't associate any real number in the codomain with any non-positive real number in the domain. Therefore, the natural logarithm function is not a total function when viewed as a function from the reals to themselves, but it is a partial function. If the domain is restricted to only include the positive reals (that is, if the natural logarithm function is viewed as a function from the positive reals to the reals), then the natural logarithm is a total function.</p>
<h3>Subtraction of natural numbers</h3>
<p>Subtraction of natural numbers (non-negative integers) can be viewed as a partial function:</p>
<p>It is only defined when <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="x \ge y" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/7/c/77c3f188e2905561a0ed31d83c26f789.png">.</p>
<h3>Bottom type</h3>
<p>In some automated theorem proving systems a partial function is considered as returning the bottom type when it is undefined. The Curry–Howard correspondence uses this to map proofs and computer programs to each other.</p>
<p>In computer science a partial function corresponds to a subroutine that raises an exception or loops forever. The IEEE floating point standard defines a not-a-number value which is returned when a floating point operation is undefined and exceptions are suppressed, e.g. when the square root of a negative number is requested.</p>
<p>In a programming language where function parameters are statically typed, a function may be defined as a partial function because the language's type system cannot express the exact domain of the function, so the programmer instead gives it the smallest domain which is expressible as a type and contains the true domain.</p>
<h3>In category theory</h3>
<p>The category of sets and partial functions is equivalent to but not isomorphic with the category of pointed sets and point-preserving maps. One textbook notes that "This formal completion of sets and partial maps by adding “improper,” “infinite” elements was reinvented many times, in particular, in topology (one-point compactification) and in theoretical computer science."</p>
<p>The category of sets and partial bijections is equivalent to its dual. It is the prototypical inverse category.</p>
<h3>In abstract algebra</h3>
<p>Partial algebra generalizes the notion of universal algebra to partial operations. An example would be a field, in which the multiplicative inversion is the only proper partial operation (because division by zero is not defined).</p>
<p>The set of all partial functions (partial transformations) on a given base <i>X</i> set forms a regular semigroup called the semigroup of all partial transformations (or the partial transformation semigroup on <i>X</i>), typically denoted by <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="\mathcal{PT}_X" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/f/6/4f63ca7d1bee73b32a9fcd6675dfe0ec.png">. The set of all partial bijections on <i>X</i> forms the symmetric inverse semigroup.</p>
