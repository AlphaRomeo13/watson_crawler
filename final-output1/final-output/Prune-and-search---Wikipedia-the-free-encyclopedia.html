<h1>Prune and search</h1>
<p><b>Prune and search</b> is a method of solving optimization problems suggested by Nimrod Megiddo in 1983. </p>
<p>The basic idea of the method is a recursive procedure in which at each step the input size is reduced ("pruned") by a constant factor 0 &lt; <i>p</i> &lt; 1. As such, it is a form of decrease and conquer algorithm, where at each step the decrease is by a constant factor. Let n be the input size, <i>T</i>(<i>n</i>) be the time complexity of the whole prune-and-search algorithm, S(n) is the time complexity of the pruning step, then <i>T</i>(<i>n</i>) obeys the following recurrence relation:</p>
<p>which has the solution <i>T</i>(<i>n</i>) = O(<i>S</i>(<i>n</i>)), since summing a geometric series only multiplies by a constant factor, namely <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="1/(1-(1-p)) = 1/p." src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/2/a/a2a7007cafc6cf0de8144a1c5e646f42.png"></p>
<p>In particular, Megiddo himself used this approach in his linear time algorithm for the linear programming problem when the dimension is fixed and for the minimal enclosing sphere problem for a set of points in space.</p>
