<h1>Intersection (set theory)</h1>
<p>In mathematics, the <b>intersection</b> <i>A</i> ∩ <i>B</i> of two sets <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> is the set that contains all elements of <i>A</i> that also belong to <i>B</i> (or equivalently, all elements of <i>B</i> that also belong to <i>A</i>), but no other elements.</p>
<p>For explanation of the symbols used in this article, refer to the table of mathematical symbols.</p>

<h2>Basic definition</h2>
<p>The intersection of <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> is written "<i>A</i> ∩ <i>B</i>". Formally:</p>
<p>that is</p>
<ul>
<li><i>x</i> ∈ <i>A</i> and</li>
<li><i>x</i> ∈ <i>B</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The intersection of the sets {1, 2, 3} and {2, 3, 4} is {2, 3}.</li>
<li>The number 9 is <i>not</i> in the intersection of the set of prime numbers {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, …} and the set of odd numbers {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, …}.</li>
</ul>
<p>More generally, one can take the intersection of several sets at once. The <i>intersection</i> of <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, and <i>D</i>, for example, is <i>A</i> ∩ <i>B</i> ∩ <i>C</i> ∩ <i>D</i> = <i>A</i> ∩ (<i>B</i> ∩ (<i>C</i> ∩ <i>D</i>)). Intersection is an associative operation; thus,<br>
<i>A</i> ∩ (<i>B</i> ∩ <i>C</i>) = (<i>A</i> ∩ <i>B</i>) ∩ <i>C</i>.</p>
<p>Inside a universe <i>U</i> one may define the complement <i>A</i> of <i>A</i> to be the set of all elements of <i>U</i> not in <i>A</i>. Now the intersection of <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> may be written as the complement of the union of their complements, derived easily from De Morgan's laws:<br>
<i>A</i> ∩ <i>B</i> = (<i>A</i> ∪ <i>B</i>)</p>
<h3>Intersecting and disjoint sets</h3>
<p>We say that <i>A intersects (meets) B at an element x</i> if <i>x</i> belongs to <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>. We say that <i>A intersects (meets) B</i> if <i>A</i> intersects B at some element. <i>A</i> intersects <i>B</i> if their intersection is inhabited.</p>
<p>We say that <i>A and B are disjoint</i> if <i>A</i> does not intersect <i>B</i>. In plain language, they have no elements in common. <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are disjoint if their intersection is empty, denoted <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="A\cap B=\varnothing" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/3/c/03c075df75c58c162fe346fab4f0944b.png">.</p>
<p>For example, the sets {1, 2} and {3, 4} are disjoint, the set of even numbers intersects the set of multiples of 3 at 0, 6, 12, 18 and other numbers.</p>
<h2>Arbitrary intersections</h2>
<p>The most general notion is the intersection of an arbitrary <i>nonempty</i> collection of sets. If <i>M</i> is a nonempty set whose elements are themselves sets, then <i>x</i> is an element of the <i>intersection</i> of <i>M</i> if and only if for every element <i>A</i> of <i>M</i>, <i>x</i> is an element of <i>A</i>. In symbols:</p>
<p>The notation for this last concept can vary considerably. Set theorists will sometimes write "⋂<i>M</i>", while others will instead write "⋂<sub><i>A</i>∈<i>M</i> </sub><i>A</i>". The latter notation can be generalized to "⋂<sub><i>i</i>∈<i>I</i></sub> <i>A</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>", which refers to the intersection of the collection {<i>A</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> : <i>i</i> ∈ <i>I</i>}. Here <i>I</i> is a nonempty set, and <i>A</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> is a set for every <i>i</i> in <i>I</i>.</p>
<p>In the case that the index set <i>I</i> is the set of natural numbers, notation analogous to that of an infinite series may be seen:</p>
<p>When formatting is difficult, this can also be written "<i>A</i><sub>1</sub> ∩ <i>A</i><sub>2</sub> ∩ <i>A</i><sub>3</sub> ∩ ...", even though strictly speaking, <i>A</i><sub>1</sub> ∩ (<i>A</i><sub>2</sub> ∩ (<i>A</i><sub>3</sub> ∩ ... makes no sense. (This last example, an intersection of countably many sets, is actually very common; for an example see the article on σ-algebras.)</p>
<p>Finally, let us note that whenever the symbol "∩" is placed <i>before</i> other symbols instead of <i>between</i> them, it should be of a larger size (⋂).</p>
<h2>Nullary intersection</h2>
<p>Note that in the previous section we excluded the case where <i>M</i> was the empty set (∅). The reason is as follows: The intersection of the collection <i>M</i> is defined as the set (see set-builder notation)</p>
<p>If <i>M</i> is empty there are no sets <i>A</i> in <i>M</i>, so the question becomes "which <i>x</i>'s satisfy the stated condition?" The answer seems to be <i>every possible x</i>. When <i>M</i> is empty the condition given above is an example of a vacuous truth. So the intersection of the empty family should be the universal set (the identity element for the operation of intersection) </p>
<p>Unfortunately, according to standard (ZFC) set theory, the universal set does not exist. A partial fix for this problem can be found if we agree to restrict our attention to subsets of a fixed set <i>U</i> called the <i>universe</i>. In this case the intersection of a family of subsets of <i>U</i> can be defined as</p>
<p>Now if <i>M</i> is empty there is no problem. The intersection is just the entire universe <i>U</i>, which is a well-defined set by assumption and becomes the identity element for this operation.</p>
