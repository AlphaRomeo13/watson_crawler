<h1>Dynamic programming</h1>
<p>In mathematics, computer science, economics, and bioinformatics, <b>dynamic programming</b> is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable to problems exhibiting the properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure (described below). When applicable, the method takes far less time than naive methods that don't take advantage of the subproblem overlap (like depth-first search).</p>
<p>The idea behind dynamic programming is quite simple. In general, to solve a given problem, we need to solve different parts of the problem (subproblems), then combine the solutions of the subproblems to reach an overall solution. Often when using a more naive method, many of the subproblems are generated and solved many times. The dynamic programming approach seeks to solve each subproblem only once, thus reducing the number of computations: once the solution to a given subproblem has been computed, it is stored or "memo-ized": the next time the same solution is needed, it is simply looked up. This approach is especially useful when the number of repeating subproblems grows exponentially as a function of the size of the input.</p>
<p>Dynamic programming algorithms are used for optimization (for example, finding the shortest path between two points, or the fastest way to multiply many matrices). A dynamic programming algorithm will examine the previously solved subproblems and will combine their solutions to give the best solution for the given problem. The alternatives are many, such as using a greedy algorithm, which picks the locally optimal choice at each branch in the road. The locally optimal choice may be a poor choice for the overall solution. While a greedy algorithm does not guarantee an optimal solution, it is often faster to calculate. Fortunately, some greedy algorithms (such as minimum spanning trees) are proven to lead to the optimal solution.</p>
<p>For example, let's say that you have to get from point A to point B as fast as possible, in a given city, during rush hour. A dynamic programming algorithm will look at finding the shortest paths to points close to A, and use those solutions to eventually find the shortest path to B. On the other hand, a greedy algorithm will start you driving immediately and will pick the road that looks the fastest at every intersection. As you can imagine, this strategy might not lead to the fastest arrival time, since you might take some "easy" streets and then find yourself hopelessly stuck in a traffic jam.</p>
<p>Sometimes, applying memoization to a naive basic recursive solution already results in an optimal dynamic programming solution; however, many problems require more sophisticated dynamic programming algorithms. Some of these may be recursive as well but parametrized differently from the naive solution. Others can be more complicated and cannot be implemented as a recursive function with memoization. Examples of these are the two solutions to the Egg Dropping puzzle below.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The term <i>dynamic programming</i> was originally used in the 1940s by Richard Bellman to describe the process of solving problems where one needs to find the best decisions one after another. By 1953, he refined this to the modern meaning, referring specifically to nesting smaller decision problems inside larger decisions, and the field was thereafter recognized by the IEEE as a systems analysis and engineering topic. Bellman's contribution is remembered in the name of the Bellman equation, a central result of dynamic programming which restates an optimization problem in recursive form.</p>
<p>Bellman explains the reasoning behind the term <i>dynamic programming</i> in his autobiography, <i>Eye of the Hurricane: An Autobiography</i> (1984). He explains:</p>
<p>The word <i>dynamic</i> was chosen by Bellman to capture the time-varying aspect of the problems, and because it sounded impressive. The word <i>programming</i> referred to the use of the method to find an optimal <i>program</i>, in the sense of a military schedule for training or logistics. This usage is the same as that in the phrases <i>linear programming</i> and <i>mathematical programming</i>, a synonym for mathematical optimization.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Dynamic programming is both a mathematical optimization method and a computer programming method. In both contexts it refers to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler subproblems in a recursive manner. While some decision problems cannot be taken apart this way, decisions that span several points in time do often break apart recursively; Bellman called this the "Principle of Optimality". Likewise, in computer science, a problem that can be solved optimally by breaking it into subproblems and then recursively finding the optimal solutions to the subproblems is said to have optimal substructure.</p>
<p>If subproblems can be nested recursively inside larger problems, so that dynamic programming methods are applicable, then there is a relation between the value of the larger problem and the values of the subproblems. In the optimization literature this relationship is called the Bellman equation.</p>
<h3>Dynamic programming in mathematical optimization</h3>
<p>In terms of mathematical optimization, dynamic programming usually refers to simplifying a decision by breaking it down into a sequence of decision steps over time. This is done by defining a sequence of <b>value functions</b> <i>V</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>V</i><sub>2</sub>, ..., <i>V</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>, with an argument <i>y</i> representing the <b>state</b> of the system at times <i>i</i> from 1 to <i>n</i>. The definition of <i>V</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>(<i>y</i>) is the value obtained in state <i>y</i> at the last time <i>n</i>. The values <i>V</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> at earlier times <i>i</i> = <i>n</i> −1, <i>n</i> − 2, ..., 2, 1 can be found by working backwards, using a recursive relationship called the Bellman equation. For <i>i</i> = 2, ..., <i>n</i>, <i>V</i><sub><i>i</i>−1</sub> at any state <i>y</i> is calculated from <i>V</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> by maximizing a simple function (usually the sum) of the gain from a decision at time <i>i</i> − 1 and the function <i>V</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> at the new state of the system if this decision is made. Since <i>V</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> has already been calculated for the needed states, the above operation yields <i>V</i><sub><i>i</i>−1</sub> for those states. Finally, <i>V</i><sub>1</sub> at the initial state of the system is the value of the optimal solution. The optimal values of the decision variables can be recovered, one by one, by tracking back the calculations already performed.</p>
<h3>Dynamic programming in bioinformatics</h3>
<p>Dynamic programming is widely used in bioinformatics for the tasks such as sequence alignment, protein folding, RNA structure prediction and protein-DNA binding. First dynamic programming algorithms for protein-DNA binding were developed in the 1970s independently by Charles DeLisi in USA and Georgii Gurskii and Alexander Zasedatelev in USSR. Recently these algorithms have become very popular in bioinformatics and computational biology, particularly in the studies of nucleosome positioning and transcription factor binding.</p>
<h3>Dynamic programming in computer programming</h3>
<p>There are two key attributes that a problem must have in order for dynamic programming to be applicable: optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems. If a problem can be solved by combining optimal solutions to <i>non-overlapping</i> subproblems, the strategy is called "divide and conquer" instead. This is why mergesort and quicksort are not classified as dynamic programming problems.</p>
<p><i>Optimal substructure</i> means that the solution to a given optimization problem can be obtained by the combination of optimal solutions to its subproblems. Consequently, the first step towards devising a dynamic programming solution is to check whether the problem exhibits such optimal substructure. Such optimal substructures are usually described by means of recursion. For example, given a graph <i>G=(V,E)</i>, the shortest path <i>p</i> from a vertex <i>u</i> to a vertex <i>v</i> exhibits optimal substructure: take any intermediate vertex <i>w</i> on this shortest path <i>p</i>. If <i>p</i> is truly the shortest path, then it can be split into subpaths <i>p<sub>1</sub></i> from <i>u</i> to <i>w</i> and <i>p<sub>2</sub></i> from <i>w</i> to <i>v</i> such that these, in turn, are indeed the shortest paths between the corresponding vertices (by the simple cut-and-paste argument described in <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i>). Hence, one can easily formulate the solution for finding shortest paths in a recursive manner, which is what the Bellman–Ford algorithm or the Floyd–Warshall algorithm does.</p>
<p><i>Overlapping</i> subproblems means that the space of subproblems must be small, that is, any recursive algorithm solving the problem should solve the same subproblems over and over, rather than generating new subproblems. For example, consider the recursive formulation for generating the Fibonacci series: <i>F</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> = <i>F</i><sub><i>i</i>−1</sub> + <i>F</i><sub><i>i</i>−2</sub>, with base case <i>F</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>F</i><sub>2</sub> = 1. Then <i>F</i><sub>43</sub> = <i>F</i><sub>42</sub> + <i>F</i><sub>41</sub>, and <i>F</i><sub>42</sub> = <i>F</i><sub>41</sub> + <i>F</i><sub>40</sub>. Now <i>F</i><sub>41</sub> is being solved in the recursive subtrees of both <i>F</i><sub>43</sub> as well as <i>F</i><sub>42</sub>. Even though the total number of subproblems is actually small (only 43 of them), we end up solving the same problems over and over if we adopt a naive recursive solution such as this. Dynamic programming takes account of this fact and solves each subproblem only once.</p>
<p>This can be achieved in either of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Top-down approach</i>: This is the direct fall-out of the recursive formulation of any problem. If the solution to any problem can be formulated recursively using the solution to its subproblems, and if its subproblems are overlapping, then one can easily memoize or store the solutions to the subproblems in a table. Whenever we attempt to solve a new subproblem, we first check the table to see if it is already solved. If a solution has been recorded, we can use it directly, otherwise we solve the subproblem and add its solution to the table.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Bottom-up approach</i>: Once we formulate the solution to a problem recursively as in terms of its subproblems, we can try reformulating the problem in a bottom-up fashion: try solving the subproblems first and use their solutions to build-on and arrive at solutions to bigger subproblems. This is also usually done in a tabular form by iteratively generating solutions to bigger and bigger subproblems by using the solutions to small subproblems. For example, if we already know the values of <i>F</i><sub>41</sub> and <i>F</i><sub>40</sub>, we can directly calculate the value of <i>F</i><sub>42</sub>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some programming languages can automatically memoize the result of a function call with a particular set of arguments, in order to speed up call-by-name evaluation (this mechanism is referred to as <i>call-by-need</i>). Some languages make it possible portably (e.g. Scheme, Common Lisp or Perl). Some languages have automatic memoization built in, such as tabled Prolog and J, which supports memoization with the <i>M.</i> adverb. In any case, this is only possible for a referentially transparent function.</p>
<h2>Example: Mathematical optimization</h2>
<h3>Optimal consumption and saving</h3>
<p>A mathematical optimization problem that is often used in teaching dynamic programming to economists (because it can be solved by hand) concerns a consumer who lives over the periods <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="t=0,1,2,\ldots,T" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/c/0/bc0e1f05b08ca470081d33ae8cbde327.png"> and must decide how much to consume and how much to save in each period.</p>
<p>Let <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="c_t" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/d/4/cd40b468a6890fe609be337d815300a3.png"> be consumption in period <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="t" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/3/5/e358efa489f58062f10dd7316b65649e.png">, and assume consumption yields utility <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="u(c_t)=\ln(c_t)" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/b/2/0b25698f7471ee130c0babad0eec74ed.png"> as long as the consumer lives. Assume the consumer is impatient, so that he discounts future utility by a factor <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="b" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/2/e/92eb5ffee6ae2fec3ad71c777531578f.png"> each period, where <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="0&lt;b&lt;1" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/f/3/5f375c9915350da438317c968dd1e8ab.png">. Let <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="k_t" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/5/2/652d7a1af66d26760cb13c43d511c0ce.png"> be capital in period <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="t" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/3/5/e358efa489f58062f10dd7316b65649e.png">.

Assume capital cannot be negative. Then the consumer's decision problem can be written as follows:</p>
<p>Written this way, the problem looks complicated, because it involves solving for all the choice variables <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="c_0, c_1, c_2, \ldots , c_T" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/4/1/b41b1a36661b18441a11fa76b091e81e.png">.

<p>The dynamic programming approach to solving this problem involves breaking it apart into a sequence of smaller decisions. To do so, we define a sequence of <i>value functions</i> <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="V_t(k)" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/0/3/c039b9327ca881e6bb7e63cd0418f27c.png">, for <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="t=0,1,2,\ldots,T,T+1" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/9/0/5905d253ef8fe0153effe0257f6f51ce.png"> which represent the value of having any amount of capital <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="k" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/c/e/8ce4b16b22b58894aa86c421e8759df3.png"> at each time <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="t" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/3/5/e358efa489f58062f10dd7316b65649e.png">.

<p>The value of any quantity of capital at any previous time can be calculated by backward induction using the Bellman equation. In this problem, for each <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="t=0,1,2,\ldots,T" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/c/0/bc0e1f05b08ca470081d33ae8cbde327.png">, the Bellman equation is</p>
<p>This problem is much simpler than the one we wrote down before, because it involves only two decision variables, <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="c_t" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/d/4/cd40b468a6890fe609be337d815300a3.png"> and <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="k_{t+1}" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/3/d/83d765279b1d89fca9bcf5d29df3d387.png">. Intuitively, instead of choosing his whole lifetime plan at birth, the consumer can take things one step at a time. At time <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="t" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/3/5/e358efa489f58062f10dd7316b65649e.png">, his current capital <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="k_t" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/5/2/652d7a1af66d26760cb13c43d511c0ce.png"> is given, and he only needs to choose current consumption <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="c_t" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/d/4/cd40b468a6890fe609be337d815300a3.png"> and saving <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="k_{t+1}" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/3/d/83d765279b1d89fca9bcf5d29df3d387.png">.</p>
<p>To actually solve this problem, we work backwards. For simplicity, the current level of capital is denoted as <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="k" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/c/e/8ce4b16b22b58894aa86c421e8759df3.png">. <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="V_{T+1}(k)" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/d/4/2d46f7b298174c4128b86086131f3e53.png"> is already known, so using the Bellman equation once we can calculate <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="V_T(k)" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/a/4/fa44677f98e15f02b8c9684ad3678aa2.png">, and so on until we get to <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="V_0(k)" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/4/9/7499f25f954af128fa0ab176585f2923.png">, which is the <i>value</i> of the initial decision problem for the whole lifetime.

<p>is a paraphrasing of Bellman's famous Principle of Optimality in the context of the shortest path problem.</p>
<h3>Fibonacci sequence</h3>
<p>Here is a naïve implementation of a function finding the <i>n</i>th member of the Fibonacci sequence, based directly on the mathematical definition:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 0b00fe76-3310-4b32-a426-73eb5be4c76e</p>
<pre>
   <b>function</b> fib(n)
       <b>if</b> n &lt;=1 <b>return</b> n
       <b>return</b> fib(n − 1) + fib(n − 2)
</pre>
<p>Notice that if we call, say, <code>fib(5)</code>, we produce a call tree that calls the function on the same value many different times:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>fib(5)</code></li>
<li><code>fib(4) + fib(3)</code></li>
<li><code>(fib(3) + fib(2)) + (fib(2) + fib(1))</code></li>
<li><code>((fib(2) + fib(1)) + (fib(1) + fib(0))) + ((fib(1) + fib(0)) + fib(1))</code></li>
<li><code>(((fib(1) + fib(0)) + fib(1)) + (fib(1) + fib(0))) + ((fib(1) + fib(0)) + fib(1))</code></li>
</ol>
<p>In particular, <code>fib(2)</code> was calculated three times from scratch. In larger examples, many more values of <code>fib</code>, or <i>subproblems</i>, are recalculated, leading to an exponential time algorithm.</p>
<p>Now, suppose we have a simple map object, <i>m</i>, which maps each value of <code>fib</code> that has already been calculated to its result, and we modify our function to use it and update it. The resulting function requires only O(<i>n</i>) time instead of exponential time (but requires O(<i>n</i>) space):</p>

<p>This technique of saving values that have already been calculated is called <i>memoization</i>; this is the top-down approach, since we first break the problem into subproblems and then calculate and store values.</p>
<p>In the <b>bottom-up</b> approach, we calculate the smaller values of <code>fib</code> first, then build larger values from them. This method also uses O(<i>n</i>) time since it contains a loop that repeats n − 1 times, but it only takes constant (O(1)) space, in contrast to the top-down approach which requires O(<i>n</i>) space to store the map.</p>

<h3>A type of balanced 0–1 matrix</h3>
<p>Consider the problem of assigning values, either zero or one, to the positions of an <var>n</var> × <var>n</var> matrix, with <var>n</var> even, so that each row and each column contains exactly <var>n</var> / 2 zeros and <var>n</var> / 2 ones. We ask how many different assignments there are for a given <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="n" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/b/8/7b8b965ad4bca0e41ab51de7b31363a1.png">. For example, when <var>n</var> = 4, four possible solutions are</p>
<p>There are at least three possible approaches: brute force, backtracking, and dynamic programming.</p>
<p>Brute force consists of checking all assignments of zeros and ones and counting those that have balanced rows and columns (<var>n</var> / 2 zeros and <var>n</var> / 2 ones). As there are <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="\tbinom{n}{n/2}^n" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/c/c/5cc722999e6cf0cfbfbf39bb8b37aeb6.png"> possible assignments, this strategy is not practical except maybe up to <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="n=6" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/7/1/f713080e186baab15f88c1f6008ceb50.png">.</p>
<p>Backtracking for this problem consists of choosing some order of the matrix elements and recursively placing ones or zeros, while checking that in every row and column the number of elements that have not been assigned plus the number of ones or zeros are both at least <var>n</var> / 2. While more sophisticated than brute force, this approach will visit every solution once, making it impractical for <var>n</var> larger than six, since the number of solutions is already 116,963,796,250 for <var>n</var> = 10, as we shall see.</p>
<p>Dynamic programming makes it possible to count the number of solutions without visiting them all. Imagine backtracking values for the first row – what information would we require about the remaining rows, in order to be able to accurately count the solutions obtained for each first row value? We consider <var>k</var> × <var>n</var> boards, where 1 ≤ <var>k</var> ≤ <var>n</var>, whose <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="k" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/c/e/8ce4b16b22b58894aa86c421e8759df3.png"> rows contain <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="n/2" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/2/f/a2f070a31330443ceb0dcf352fe50035.png"> zeros and <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="n/2" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/2/f/a2f070a31330443ceb0dcf352fe50035.png"> ones.

If any one of the results is negative, then the assignment is invalid and does not contribute to the set of solutions (recursion stops). Otherwise, we have an assignment for the top row of the <var>k</var> × <var>n</var> board and recursively compute the number of solutions to the remaining (<var>k</var> − 1) × <var>n</var> board, adding the numbers of solutions for every admissible assignment of the top row and returning the sum, which is being memoized.

<h3>Checkerboard</h3>
<p>Consider a checkerboard with <i>n</i> × <i>n</i> squares and a cost-function <i>c</i>(<i>i</i>, <i>j</i>) which returns a cost associated with square <i>i</i>, <i>j</i> (<i>i</i> being the row, <i>j</i> being the column). For instance (on a 5 × 5 checkerboard),</p>
<p>Thus <i>c</i>(1, 3) = 5</p>
<p>Let us say you had a checker that could start at any square on the first rank (i.e., row) and you wanted to know the shortest path (sum of the costs of the visited squares are at a minimum) to get to the last rank, assuming the checker could move only diagonally left forward, diagonally right forward, or straight forward. That is, a checker on (1,3) can move to (2,2), (2,3) or (2,4).</p>
<p>This problem exhibits <b>optimal substructure</b>. That is, the solution to the entire problem relies on solutions to subproblems. Let us define a function <i>q</i>(<i>i</i>, <i>j</i>) as</p>
<p>If we can find the values of this function for all the squares at rank <i>n</i>, we pick the minimum and follow that path backwards to get the shortest path.</p>
<p>Note that <i>q</i>(<i>i</i>, <i>j</i>) is equal to the minimum cost to get to any of the three squares below it (since those are the only squares that can reach it) plus <i>c</i>(<i>i</i>, <i>j</i>). For instance:</p>
<p>Now, let us define <i>q</i>(<i>i</i>, <i>j</i>) in somewhat more general terms:</p>
<p>The first line of this equation is there to make the recursive property simpler (when dealing with the edges, so we need only one recursion). The second line says what happens in the last rank, to provide a base case. The third line, the recursion, is the important part. It is similar to the A,B,C,D example. From this definition we can make a straightforward recursive code for <i>q</i>(<i>i</i>, <i>j</i>). In the following pseudocode, <i>n</i> is the size of the board, <code>c(i, j)</code> is the cost-function, and <code>min()</code> returns the minimum of a number of values:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 027142b0-dc84-4f8f-97f4-4830a9ad7eaa</p>
<pre>
<b>function</b> minCost(i, j)
    <b>if</b> j &lt; 1 <b>or</b> j &gt; n
        <b>return</b> infinity
    <b>else if</b> i = 1
        <b>return</b> c(i, j)
    <b>else</b>
        <b>return</b> <b>min</b>( minCost(i-1, j-1), minCost(i-1, j), minCost(i-1, j+1) ) + c(i, j)
</pre>
<p>It should be noted that this function only computes the path-cost, not the actual path. We will get to the path soon. This, like the Fibonacci-numbers example, is horribly slow since it wastes time recomputing the same shortest paths over and over. However, we can compute it much faster in a bottom-up fashion if we store path-costs in a two-dimensional array <code>q[i, j]</code> rather than using a function. This avoids recomputation; before computing the cost of a path, we check the array <code>q[i, j]</code> to see if the path cost is already there.</p>
<p>We also need to know what the actual shortest path is. To do this, we use another array <code>p[i, j]</code>, a <i>predecessor array</i>. This array implicitly stores the path to any square <i>s</i> by storing the previous node on the shortest path to <i>s</i>, i.e. the predecessor. To reconstruct the path, we lookup the predecessor of <i>s</i>, then the predecessor of that square, then the predecessor of that square, and so on, until we reach the starting square. Consider the following code:</p>

             q[y, x] := m + c(y, x)
             <b>if</b> m = q[y-1, x-1]

<h3>Sequence alignment</h3>
<p>In genetics, sequence alignment is an important application where dynamic programming is essential. Typically, the problem consists of transforming one sequence into another using edit operations that replace, insert, or remove an element. Each operation has an associated cost, and the goal is to find the sequence of edits with the lowest total cost.</p>
<p>The problem can be stated naturally as a recursion, a sequence A is optimally edited into a sequence B by either:</p>
<ol>
<li>inserting the first character of B, and performing an optimal alignment of A and the tail of B</li>
<li>deleting the first character of A, and performing the optimal alignment of the tail of A and B</li>
<li>replacing the first character of A with the first character of B, and performing optimal alignments of the tails of A and B.</li>
</ol>
<p>The partial alignments can be tabulated in a matrix, where cell (i,j) contains the cost of the optimal alignment of A[1..i] to B[1..j]. The cost in cell (i,j) can be calculated by adding the cost of the relevant operations to the cost of its neighboring cells, and selecting the optimum.</p>
<p>Different variants exist, see Smith–Waterman algorithm and Needleman–Wunsch algorithm.</p>
<h3>Tower of Hanoi puzzle</h3>
<p>The <b>Tower of Hanoi</b> or <b>Towers of Hanoi</b> is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.</p>
<p>The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only one disk may be moved at a time.</li>
<li>Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and sliding it onto another rod, on top of the other disks that may already be present on that rod.</li>
<li>No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.</li>
</ul>
<p>The dynamic programming solution consists of solving the functional equation</p>
<p>where n denotes the number of disks to be moved, h denotes the home rod, t denotes the target rod, not(h,t) denotes the third rod (neither h nor t), ";" denotes concatenation, and</p>
<p>Note that for n=1 the problem is trivial, namely S(1,h,t) = "move a disk from rod h to rod t" (there is only one disk left).</p>
<p>The number of moves required by this solution is 2 − 1. If the objective is to <b>maximize</b> the number of moves (without cycling) then the dynamic programming functional equation is slightly more complicated and 3 − 1 moves are required.</p>
<h3>Egg dropping puzzle</h3>
<p>The following is a description of the instance of this famous puzzle involving n=2 eggs and a building with H=36 floors:</p>
<ul>
<li>An egg that survives a fall can be used again.</li>
<li>A broken egg must be discarded.</li>
<li>The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.</li>
<li>If an egg breaks when dropped, then it would break if dropped from a higher window.</li>
<li>If an egg survives a fall, then it would survive a shorter fall.</li>
<li>It is not ruled out that the first-floor windows break eggs, nor is it ruled out that eggs can survive the 36th-floor windows.</li>
</ul>
<p>To derive a dynamic programming functional equation for this puzzle, let the <b>state</b> of the dynamic programming model be a pair s = (n,k), where</p>
<p>For instance, <i>s</i> = (2,6) indicates that two test eggs are available and 6 (consecutive) floors are yet to be tested. The initial state of the process is <i>s</i> = (<i>N</i>,<i>H</i>) where <i>N</i> denotes the number of test eggs available at the commencement of the experiment. The process terminates either when there are no more test eggs (<i>n</i> = 0) or when <i>k</i> = 0, whichever occurs first. If termination occurs at state <i>s</i> = (0,<i>k</i>) and <i>k</i> &gt; 0, then the test failed.</p>
<p>Now, let</p>
<p>Then it can be shown that</p>
<p>with <i>W</i>(<i>n</i>,1) = 1 for all <i>n</i> &gt; 0 and <i>W</i>(1,<i>k</i>) = <i>k</i> for all <i>k</i>. It is easy to solve this equation iteratively by systematically increasing the values of <i>n</i> and <i>k</i>.</p>
<p>An interactive online facility is available for experimentation with this model as well as with other versions of this puzzle (e.g. when the objective is to minimize the <b>expected value</b> of the number of trials.)</p>

<h3>Matrix chain multiplication</h3>
<p>Matrix chain multiplication is a well known example that demonstrates utility of dynamic programming. For example, engineering applications often have to multiply a chain of matrices. It is not surprising to find matrices of large dimensions, for example 100×100. Therefore, our task is to multiply matrices A1, A2, .... An. As we know from basic linear algebra, matrix multiplication is not commutative, but is associative; and we can multiply only two matrices at a time. So, we can multiply this chain of matrices in many different ways, for example:</p>
<p>and so on. There are numerous ways to multiply this chain of matrices. They will all produce the same final result, however they will take more or less time to compute, based on which particular matrices are multiplied. If matrix A has dimensions m×n and matrix B has dimensions n×q, then matrix C=A×B will have dimensions m×q, and will require m*n*q scalar multiplications (using a simplistic matrix multiplication algorithm for purposes of illustration).</p>
<p>For example, let us multiply matrices A, B and C. Let us assume that their dimensions are m×n, n×p, and p×s, respectively. Matrix A×B×C will be of size m×s and can be calculated in two ways shown below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ax(B×C) This order of matrix multiplication will require nps + mns scalar multiplications.</li>
<li>(A×B)×C This order of matrix multiplication will require mnp + mps scalar calculations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us assume that m = 10, n = 100, p = 10 and s = 1000. So, the first way to multiply the chain will require 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 calculations. The second way will require only 10,000+100,000 calculations. Obviously, the second way is faster, and we should multiply the matrices using that arrangement of parenthesis.</p>
<p>Therefore, our conclusion is that the order of parenthesis matters, and that our task is to find the optimal order of parenthesis.</p>
<p>At this point, we have several choices, one of which is to design a dynamic programming algorithm that will split the problem into overlapping problems and calculate the optimal arrangement of parenthesis. The dynamic programming solution is presented below.</p>
<p>Let's call m[i,j] the minimum number of scalar multiplications needed to multiply a chain of matrices from matrix i to matrix j (i.e. A<sub>i</sub> × .... × A<sub>j</sub>, i.e. i&lt;=j). We split the chain at some matrix k, such that i &lt;= k &lt; j, and try to find out which combination produces minimum m[i,j].</p>
<p>The formula is:</p>

<pre>
       <b>if</b> i = j, m[i,j]= 0
       <b>if</b> i &lt; j, m[i,j]= min over all possible values of k (<img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="m[i,k]+m[k+1,j] + p_{i-1}*p_k*p_j" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/f/d/0fdf02bfa159975c00c0af229e366403.png">)

</ul>
<p>This formula can be coded as shown below, where input parameter "chain" is the chain of matrices, i.e. <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="A_1, A_2, ... A_n" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/4/e/04e91f6a22fe05a09b29052feedc2f89.png">:</p>

</pre>
<p>So far, we have calculated values for all possible <i>m</i>[<i>i</i>, <i>j</i>], the minimum number of calculations to multiply a chain from matrix <i>i</i> to matrix <i>j</i>, and we have recorded the corresponding "split point"<i>s</i>[<i>i</i>, <i>j</i>]. For example, if we are multiplying chain A<sub>1</sub>×A<sub>2</sub>×A<sub>3</sub>×A<sub>4</sub>, and it turns out that <i>m</i>[1, 3] = 100 and <i>s</i>[1, 3] = 2, that means that the optimal placement of parenthesis for matrices 1 to 3 is (A1×A2)×A3 and to multiply those matrices will require 100 scalar calculation.</p>
<p>This algorithm will produce "tables" <i>m</i>[, ] and <i>s</i>[, ] that will have entries for all possible values of i and j. The final solution for the entire chain is m[1, n], with corresponding split at s[1, n]. Unraveling the solution will be recursive, starting from the top and continuing until we reach the base case, i.e. multiplication of single matrices.</p>
<p>Therefore, the next step is to actually split the chain, i.e. to place the parenthesis where they (optimally) belong. For this purpose we could use the following algorithm:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 6f629b18-fd6b-4946-8c17-2d261c384273</p>
<pre>
 <b>function</b> PrintOptimalParenthesis(s, i, j)
     <b>if</b> i = j
        print "A"i
     <b>else</b>
        print "("  PrintOptimalParenthesis(s, i, s[i, j])  PrintOptimalParenthesis(s, s[i, j] + 1, j) ")"
       
</pre>
<p>Of course, this algorithm is not useful for actual multiplication. This algorithm is just a user-friendly way to see what the result looks like.</p>
<p>To actually multiply the matrices using the proper splits, we need the following algorithm:</p>
