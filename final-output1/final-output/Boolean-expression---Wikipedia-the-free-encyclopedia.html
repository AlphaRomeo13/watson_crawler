<h1>Boolean expression</h1>
<p>In computer science, a <b>Boolean expression</b> is an expression in a programming language that produces a Boolean value when evaluated, i.e. one of <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>. A Boolean expression may be composed of a combination of the Boolean constants <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>, Boolean-typed variables, Boolean-valued operators, and Boolean-valued functions.</p>
<p>Boolean expressions correspond to propositional formulas in logic and are a special case of Boolean circuits.</p>

<h2>Boolean operators</h2>
<p>Most programming languages have the Boolean operators OR, AND and NOT; in C and some newer languages, these are represented by "||" (double pipe character), "&amp;&amp;" (double ampersand) and "!" (exclamation point) respectively, while the corresponding bitwise operations are represented by "|", "&amp;" and "~" (tilde). In the mathematical literature the symbols used are often "+" (plus), "<b>·</b>" (dot) and overbar, or "∨" (cup), "∧" (cap) and "¬" or "′" (prime).</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<ul>
<li>The expression "5 &gt; 3" is evaluated as <b>true</b>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"5&gt;=3" and "3&lt;=5" are equivalent Boolean expressions, both of which are evaluated as <b>true</b>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Of course, most Boolean expressions will contain at least one variable (X &gt; 3), and often more (X &gt; Y).</li>
