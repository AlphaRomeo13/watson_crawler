<h1>Euclidean distance</h1>
<p>In mathematics, the <b>Euclidean distance</b> or <b>Euclidean metric</b> is the "ordinary" distance between two points in Euclidean space. With this distance, Euclidean space becomes a metric space. The associated norm is called the <b>Euclidean norm.</b> Older literature refers to the metric as <b>Pythagorean metric</b>.</p>

<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>The <b>Euclidean distance</b> between points <b>p</b> and <b>q</b> is the length of the line segment connecting them (<img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="\overline{\mathbf{p}\mathbf{q}}" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/b/6/db6519a859e3594037babfeacace4f5f.png">).</p>
<p>In Cartesian coordinates, if <b>p</b> = (<i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>,..., <i>p</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>) and <b>q</b> = (<i>q</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>q</i><sub>2</sub>,..., <i>q</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>) are two points in Euclidean <i>n</i>-space, then the distance (d) from <b>p</b> to <b>q</b>, or from <b>q</b> to <b>p</b> is given by the Pythagorean formula:</p>
<p><img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="\begin{align}\mathrm{d}(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q}) = \mathrm{d}(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p}) &amp; = \sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^2 + (q_2-p_2)^2 + \cdots + (q_n-p_n)^2} \\[8pt]

<p><b>(1)</b></p>
<p>The position of a point in a Euclidean <i>n</i>-space is a Euclidean vector. So, <b>p</b> and <b>q</b> are Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space, and their tips indicate two points. The <b>Euclidean norm</b>, or <b>Euclidean length</b>, or <b>magnitude</b> of a vector measures the length of the vector:</p>
<p>where the last equation involves the dot product.</p>
<p>A vector can be described as a directed line segment from the origin of the Euclidean space (vector tail), to a point in that space (vector tip). If we consider that its length is actually the distance from its tail to its tip, it becomes clear that the Euclidean norm of a vector is just a special case of Euclidean distance: the Euclidean distance between its tail and its tip.</p>
<p>The distance between points <b>p</b> and <b>q</b> may have a direction (e.g. from <b>p</b> to <b>q</b>), so it may be represented by another vector, given by</p>
<p>In a three-dimensional space (<i>n</i>=3), this is an arrow from <b>p</b> to <b>q</b>, which can be also regarded as the position of <b>q</b> relative to <b>p</b>. It may be also called a displacement vector if <b>p</b> and <b>q</b> represent two positions of the same point at two successive instants of time.</p>
<p>The Euclidean distance between <b>p</b> and <b>q</b> is just the Euclidean length of this distance (or displacement) vector:</p>
<p><img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="\|\mathbf{q} - \mathbf{p}\| = \sqrt{(\mathbf{q}-\mathbf{p})\cdot(\mathbf{q}-\mathbf{p})}." src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/4/7/0471feb370332f02e4fd9c158fa33a9f.png"></p>

<p><b>(2)</b></p>
<p>which is equivalent to equation 1, and also to:</p>
<h3>One dimension</h3>
<p>In one dimension, the distance between two points on the real line is the absolute value of their numerical difference. Thus if <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are two points on the real line, then the distance between them is given by:</p>
<p>In one dimension, there is a single homogeneous, translation-invariant metric (in other words, a distance that is induced by a norm), up to a scale factor of length, which is the Euclidean distance. In higher dimensions there are other possible norms.</p>
<h3>Two dimensions</h3>
<p>In the Euclidean plane, if <b>p</b> = (<i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>) and <b>q</b> = (<i>q</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>q</i><sub>2</sub>) then the distance is given by</p>
<p>This is equivalent to the Pythagorean theorem.</p>
<p>Alternatively, it follows from (2) that if the polar coordinates of the point <b>p</b> are (<i>r</i><sub>1</sub>, θ<sub>1</sub>) and those of <b>q</b> are (<i>r</i><sub>2</sub>, θ<sub>2</sub>), then the distance between the points is</p>
<h3>Three dimensions</h3>
<p>In three-dimensional Euclidean space, the distance is</p>
<h3><i>n</i> dimensions</h3>
<p>In general, for an <i>n</i>-dimensional space, the distance is</p>
<h3>Squared Euclidean distance</h3>
<p>The standard Euclidean distance can be squared in order to place progressively greater weight on objects that are farther apart. In this case, the equation becomes</p>
<p>Squared Euclidean Distance is not a metric as it does not satisfy the triangle inequality, however it is frequently used in optimization problems in which distances only have to be compared.</p>
<p>It is also referred to as quadrance within the field of rational trigonometry.</p>
