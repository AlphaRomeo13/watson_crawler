<h1>Loop (graph theory)</h1>
<p>In graph theory, a <b>loop</b> (also called a <b>self-loop</b> or a "buckle") is an edge that connects a vertex to itself. A simple graph contains no loops.</p>
<p>Depending on the context, a graph or a multigraph may be defined so as to either allow or disallow the presence of loops (often in concert with allowing or disallowing multiple edges between the same vertices):</p>
<ul>
<li>Where graphs are defined so as to <i>allow</i> loops and multiple edges, a graph without loops or multiple edges is often distinguished from other graphs by calling it a "simple graph".</li>
<li>Where graphs are defined so as to <i>disallow</i> loops and multiple edges, a graph that does have loops or multiple edges is often distinguished from the graphs that satisfy these constraints by calling it a "multigraph" or "pseudograph".</li>
</ul>

<h2>Degree</h2>
<p>For an undirected graph, the degree of a vertex is equal to the number of adjacent vertices.</p>
<p>A special case is a loop, which adds two to the degree. This can be understood by letting each connection of the loop edge count as its own adjacent vertex. In other words, a vertex with a loop "sees" itself as an adjacent vertex from <i>both</i> ends of the edge thus adding two, not one, to the degree.</p>
<p>For a directed graph, a loop adds one to the in degree and one to the out degree</p>
