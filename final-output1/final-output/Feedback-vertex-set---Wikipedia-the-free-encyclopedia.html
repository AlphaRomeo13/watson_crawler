<h1>Feedback vertex set</h1>
<p>In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, a <b>feedback vertex set</b> of a graph is a set of vertices whose removal leaves a graph without cycles. In other words, each feedback vertex set contains at least one vertex of any cycle in the graph. The <b>feedback vertex set problem</b> is an NP-complete problem in computational complexity theory. It was among the first problems shown to be NP-complete. It has wide applications in operating systems, database systems, and VLSI chip design.</p>

<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>The decision problem is as follows:</p>
<p>The graph <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="G[V \setminus X]" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/c/f/ecf8b1fc5a90429399e0bac2d253ef81.png"> that remains after removing <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="X" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/2/1/02129bb861061d1a052c592e2dc6b383.png"> from <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="G" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/f/c/dfcf28d0734569a6a693bc8194de62bf.png"> is an induced forest (resp. an induced directed acyclic graph in the case of directed graphs). Thus, finding a minimum feedback vertex set in a graph is equivalent to finding a maximum induced forest (resp. maximum induced directed acyclic graph in the case of directed graphs).</p>
<h2>NP-hardness</h2>
<p>Karp (1972) showed that the feedback vertex set problem for directed graphs is NP-complete. The problem remains NP-complete on directed graphs with maximum in-degree and out-degree two, and on directed planar graphs with maximum in-degree and out-degree three. Karp's reduction also implies the NP-completeness of the feedback vertex set problem on undirected graphs, where the problem stays NP-hard on graphs of maximum degree four. The feedback vertex set problem can be solved in polynomial time on graphs of maximum degree at most three.</p>
<p>Note that the problem of deleting as few <i>edges</i> as possible to make the graph cycle-free is equivalent to finding a spanning tree, which can be done in polynomial time. In contrast, the problem of deleting edges from a directed graph to make it acyclic, the feedback arc set problem, is NP-complete.</p>
<h2>Exact algorithms</h2>
<p>The corresponding NP optimization problem of finding the size of a minimum feedback vertex set can be solved in time <i>O</i>(1.7347), where <i>n</i> is the number of vertices in the graph. This algorithm actually computes a maximum induced forest, and when such a forest is obtained, its complement is a minimum feedback vertex set. The number of minimal feedback vertex sets in a graph is bounded by <i>O</i>(1.8638). The directed feedback vertex set problem can still be solved in time <i>O*</i>(1.9977), where <i>n</i> is the number of vertices in the given directed graph. The parameterized versions of the directed and undirected problems are both fixed-parameter tractable.</p>
<h2>Approximation</h2>
<p>The problem is APX-complete, which directly follows from the APX-completeness of the vertex cover problem, and the existence of an approximation preserving L-reduction from the vertex cover problem to it. The best known approximation algorithm on undirected graphs is by a factor of two.</p>
<h2>Bounds</h2>
<p>According to the Erdős–Pósa theorem, the size of a minimum feedback vertex set is within a logarithmic factor of the maximum number of vertex-disjoint cycles in the given graph.</p>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<p>In operating systems, feedback vertex sets play a prominent role in the study of deadlock recovery. In the wait-for graph of an operating system, each directed cycle corresponds to a deadlock situation. In order to resolve all deadlocks, some blocked processes have to be aborted. A minimum feedback vertex set in this graph corresponds to a minimum number of processes that one needs to abort.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the feedback vertex set problem has applications in VLSI chip design.</p>
