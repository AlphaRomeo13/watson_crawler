<h1>Gnome sort</h1>
<p><b>Gnome sort (Stupid sort)</b>, originally proposed by Dr. Hamid Sarbazi-Azad (Professor of Computer Engineering at Sharif University of Technology) in 2000 and called Stupid sort (not to be confused with Bogosort), and then later on described by Dick Grune and named "Gnome sort" from the observation that it is "how a gnome sorts a line of flower pots".  It is a sorting algorithm which is similar to insertion sort, except that moving an element to its proper place is accomplished by a series of swaps, as in bubble sort. It is conceptually simple, requiring no nested loops. The running time is <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="O(n^2)" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/8/9/189317b4b935a745fcfaf95940d2b4f0.png">, but tends towards <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="O(n)" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/b/a/7ba55e7c64a9405a0b39a1107e90ca94.png"> if the list is initially almost sorted. In practice the algorithm can run as fast as Insertion sort. The average runtime is <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="O(n^2)" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/8/9/189317b4b935a745fcfaf95940d2b4f0.png">.</p>
<p>The algorithm always finds the first place where two adjacent elements are in the wrong order, and swaps them. It takes advantage of the fact that performing a swap can introduce a new out-of-order adjacent pair only right before or after the two swapped elements. It does not assume that elements forward of the current position are sorted, so it only needs to check the position directly before the swapped elements.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Here is pseudocode for the gnome sort using a zero-based array:</p>

<pre>
<code>procedure gnomeSort(a[])
    pos := 1
    while pos &lt; length(a)
        if (a[pos] &gt;= a[pos-1])
            pos := pos + 1
        else
            swap a[pos] and a[pos-1]
            if (pos &gt; 1)
                pos := pos - 1
            end if
        end if
    end while
end procedure

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Given an unsorted array, a = [5, 3, 2, 4], the gnome sort would take the following steps during the while loop. The "current position" is highlighted in <b>bold</b>:</p>
<h2>Optimization</h2>
<p>The gnome sort may be optimized by introducing a variable to store the position before traversing back toward the beginning of the list. This would allow the "gnome" to teleport back to his previous position after moving a flower pot. With this optimization, the gnome sort would become a variant of the insertion sort. The animation in the introduction to this topic takes advantage of this optimization.</p>
