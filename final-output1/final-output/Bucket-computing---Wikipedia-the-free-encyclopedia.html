<h1>Bucket (computing)</h1>
<p>In computing, the term <b>bucket</b> can have several meanings. It is used both as a live metaphor, and as a generally accepted technical term in some specialised areas. A <b>bucket</b> is most commonly a type of data buffer or a type of document in which data is divided into regions.</p>

<h2>Types of bucket</h2>
<h3>Bit bucket</h3>
<p>This is a humorous but common phrase. Something goes into the <b>bit bucket</b> when it is deleted, generally irreversibly and quite often wrongly, such as files or emails that just disappear.</p>
<p>It has been commonly suggested that this usage dates from the days when punched cards and/or punched tape were common. Card and paper-tape punches each had a receptacle for the 'chips' punched from the cards or tape to create the holes (rectangular in a card, round in a paper tape), which often looked like a bucket and was known by this name. By analogy it was jokingly suggested that the CPU, which in those days was an equipment rack of similar size to a large peripheral unit, contained a similar receptacle for lost data.</p>
<h3>Documentation bucket</h3>
<p>A <b>bucket</b> is a document of no definite size to which information of interest is added with no structure. Many software packages have a README file which is a bucket containing the very latest information. In IBM culture, such a file is known as a bucket and is opened for critical fixes and fix packages.</p>
<h3>Bucket (buffer)</h3>
<p>Buffers known as <b>buckets</b> are used:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the bucket sort algorithm.</li>
<li>In bucket elimination algorithms.</li>
<li>In the token bucket (TB) algorithm for network traffic shaping.</li>
<li>In the leaky bucket (LB) algorithm for network traffic shaping.</li>
<li>In bucket brigade algorithms.</li>
