<h1>Symmetric relation</h1>
<p>In mathematics and other areas, a binary relation <i>R</i> over a set <i>X</i> is <b>symmetric</b> if it holds for all <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> in <i>X</i> that if <i>a</i> is related to <i>b</i> then <i>b</i> is related to <i>a</i>.</p>
<p>In mathematical notation, this is:</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>In mathematics</h3>
<ul>
<li>"is equal to" (equality) (whereas "is less than" is not symmetric)</li>
<li>"is comparable to", for elements of a partially ordered set</li>
<li>"... and ... are odd":</li>
</ul>
<h3>Outside mathematics</h3>
<ul>
<li>"is married to" (in most legal systems)</li>
<li>"is a fully biological sibling of"</li>
<li>"is a homophone of"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Relationship to asymmetric and antisymmetric relations</h2>
<p>By definition, a relation cannot be both symmetric and asymmetric (where if <i>a</i> is related to <i>b</i>, then <i>b</i> cannot be related to <i>a</i> (in the same way)). However, a relation can be neither symmetric nor asymmetric, which is the case for "is less than or equal to" and "preys on").</p>
<p>Symmetric and antisymmetric (where the only way <i>a</i> can be related to <i>b</i> and <i>b</i> be related to <i>a</i> is if <i>a</i> = <i>b</i>) are actually independent of each other, as these examples show.</p>
<h2>Additional aspects</h2>
<p>A symmetric relation that is also transitive and reflexive is an equivalence relation.</p>
<p>One way to conceptualize a symmetric relation in graph theory is that a symmetric relation is an edge, with the edge's two vertices being the two entities so related. Thus, symmetric relations and undirected graphs are combinatorially equivalent objects.</p>
