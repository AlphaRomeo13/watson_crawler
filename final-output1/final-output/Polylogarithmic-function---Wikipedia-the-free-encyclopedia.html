<h1>Polylogarithmic function</h1>
<p>A <b>polylogarithmic function</b> in <i>n</i> is a polynomial in the logarithm of <i>n</i>,</p>
<p>In computer science, polylogarithmic functions occur as the order of memory used by some algorithms (e.g., "it has polylogarithmic order").</p>
<p>All polylogarithmic functions are</p>
<p>for every exponent <i>ε</i> &gt; 0 (for the meaning of this symbol, see small o notation), that is, a polylogarithmic function grows more slowly than any positive exponent. This observation is the basis for the soft O notation.</p>
