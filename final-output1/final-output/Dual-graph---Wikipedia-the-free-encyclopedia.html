<h1>Dual graph</h1>
<p>In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, the <b>dual graph</b> of a plane graph <i>G</i> is a graph that has a vertex corresponding to each face of <i>G</i>, and an edge joining two neighboring faces for each edge in <i>G</i>. The term "dual" is used because this property is symmetric, meaning that if <i>H</i> is a dual of <i>G</i>, then <i>G</i> is a dual of <i>H</i> (if <i>G</i> is connected). The same notion of duality may also be used for more general embeddings of graphs in manifolds.</p>
<p>The notion described in this page is different from the edge-to-vertex dual (Line graph) of a graph and should not be confused with it.</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>
<ul>
<li>The dual of a plane graph is a plane multigraph - multiple edges.</li>
<li>If <i>G</i> is a connected plane graph and if <i>G</i>′ is the dual of <i>G</i> then <i>G</i> is isomorphic to the dual of <i>G</i>′.</li>
<li>Since the dual graph depends on a particular embedding, the dual graph of a planar graph is not unique in the sense that the same planar graph can have non-isomorphic dual graphs. In the picture, the red graphs are not isomorphic because the upper one has a vertex with degree 6 (the outer face). However, if the graph is 3-connected, then Whitney showed that the embedding, and thus the dual graph, is unique.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the duality, any result involving counting faces and vertices can be dualized by exchanging them.</p>
<h2>Algebraic dual</h2>
<p>Let <i>G</i> be a connected graph. An <b>algebraic dual</b> of <i>G</i> is a graph <i>G</i> such that <i>G</i> and <i>G</i> have the same set of edges, any cycle of <i>G</i> is a cut of <i>G</i>, and any cut of <i>G</i> is a cycle of <i>G</i>. Every planar graph has an algebraic dual, which is in general not unique (any dual defined by a plane embedding will do). The converse is actually true, as settled by Hassler Whitney in the Whitney's planarity criterion:</p>
<p>The same fact can be expressed in the theory of matroids: if <i>M</i> is the graphic matroid of a graph <i>G</i>, then the dual matroid of <i>M</i> is a graphic matroid if and only if <i>G</i> is planar. If <i>G</i> is planar, the dual matroid is the graphic matroid of the dual graph of <i>G</i>.</p>
<h2>Weak dual</h2>
<p>The <b>weak dual</b> of a plane graph is the subgraph of the dual graph whose vertices correspond to the bounded faces of the primal graph. A plane graph is outerplanar if and only if its weak dual is a forest, and a plane graph is a Halin graph if and only if its weak dual is biconnected and outerplanar. For any plane graph <i>G</i>, let <i>G</i> be the plane multigraph formed by adding a single new vertex <i>v</i> in the unbounded face of <i>G</i>, and connecting <i>v</i> to each vertex of the outer face (multiple times, if a vertex appears multiple times on the boundary of the outer face); then, <i>G</i> is the weak dual of the (plane) dual of <i>G</i>.</p>
