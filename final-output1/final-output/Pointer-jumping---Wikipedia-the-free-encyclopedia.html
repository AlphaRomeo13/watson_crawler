<h1>Pointer jumping</h1>
<p><b>Pointer jumping</b> or <b>path doubling</b> is a parallel algorithm used to follow paths in graphs. Although pointer jumping specifically finds the roots of a forest of rooted trees, pointer jumping can also be applied to parallelize many other graph algorithms including connected components, minimum spanning trees, and biconnected components.</p>
<h2>Algorithm</h2>
<p>Following a paths in a graphs is an inherently serial operation, but pointer jumping reduces the total amount of work by following all paths simultaneously and sharing results among dependent operations. Pointer jumping iterates and finds a <i>successor</i> — a vertex closer to the tree root — each time. By following successors computed for other vertices, the traversal down each path can be doubled every iteration, which means that the tree roots can be found in logarithmic time.</p>
<p>Pointer doubling operates on an array <tt>successor</tt> with an entry for every vertex in the graph. Each <tt>successor[<i>i</i>]</tt> is initialized with the parent index of vertex <tt><i>i</i></tt> if that vertex is not a root or to <tt><i>i</i></tt> itself if that vertex is a root. At each iteration, each successor is updated to its successor's successor. The root is found when the successor's successor points to itself.</p>
<p>The following pseudocode demonstrates the algorithm.</p>

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> An array parent representing a forest of trees. parrent[i] is the parent of vertex i or itself for a root
<b>Output:</b> An array containing the root ancestor for every vertex

<b>for</b> <i>i</i> ← 1 <b>to</b> length(parent) <b>do in parallel</b>
    successor[<i>i</i>] ← parent[<i>i</i>]
<b>while</b> true
    <b>for</b> <i>i</i> ← 1 <b>to</b> length(successor) <b>do in parallel</b>
       successor_next[<i>i</i>] ← successor[successor[<i>i</i>]]
   <b>if</b> successor_next = successor <b>then</b>
       break
    <b>for</b> <i>i</i> ← 1 <b>to</b> length(successor) <b>do in parallel</b>
       successor[<i>i</i>] ← successor_next[<i>i</i>]
<b>return</b> successor

<p>The following image provides an example of using pointer jumping on a small forest. On each iteration the successor points to the vertex following one more successor. After two iterations, every vertex points to its root node.</p>
