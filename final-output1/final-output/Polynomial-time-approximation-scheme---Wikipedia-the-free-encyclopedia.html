<h1>Polynomial-time approximation scheme</h1>
<p>In computer science, a <b>polynomial-time approximation scheme</b> (<b>PTAS</b>) is a type of approximation algorithm for optimization problems (most often, NP-hard optimization problems).</p>
<p>A PTAS is an algorithm which takes an instance of an optimization problem and a parameter ε &gt; 0 and, in polynomial time, produces a solution that is within a factor 1 + ε of being optimal (or 1 - ε for maximization problems). For example, for the Euclidean traveling salesman problem, a PTAS would produce a tour with length at most (1 + ε)<i>L</i>, with <i>L</i> being the length of the shortest tour.</p>
<p>The running time of a PTAS is required to be polynomial in <i>n</i> for every fixed ε but can be different for different ε. Thus an algorithm running in time <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>) or even <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>) counts as a PTAS.</p>

<h2>Variants</h2>
<h3>Deterministic</h3>
<p>A practical problem with PTAS algorithms is that the exponent of the polynomial could increase dramatically as ε shrinks, for example if the runtime is O(<i>n</i>). One way of addressing this is to define the <b>efficient polynomial-time approximation scheme</b> or <b>EPTAS</b>, in which the running time is required to be <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>) for a constant <i>c</i> independent of ε. This ensures that an increase in problem size has the same relative effect on runtime regardless of what ε is being used; however, the constant under the big-O can still depend on ε arbitrarily. Even more restrictive, and useful in practice, is the <b>fully polynomial-time approximation scheme</b> or <b>FPTAS</b>, which requires the algorithm to be polynomial in both the problem size <i>n</i> and 1/ε. All problems in FPTAS are fixed-parameter tractable. An example of a problem that has an FPTAS is the knapsack problem.</p>
<p>Any strongly NP-hard optimization problem with a polynomially bounded objective function cannot have an FPTAS unless P=NP. However, the converse fails: e.g. if P does not equal NP, knapsack with two constraints is not strongly NP-hard, but has no FPTAS even when the optimal objective is polynomially bounded.</p>
<p>Unless P = NP, it holds that FPTAS ⊊ PTAS ⊊ APX. Consequently, under this assumption, APX-hard problems do not have PTASs.</p>
<p>Another deterministic variant of the PTAS is the <b>quasi-polynomial-time approximation scheme</b> or <b>QPTAS</b>. A QPTAS has time complexity <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="n^{polylog(n)}" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/c/f/7cf4bf822a42ac1aebe57350854a9a6b.png"> for each fixed <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="\epsilon &gt;0" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/7/7/e778429d8769714354b1994984a23fe5.png">.</p>
<h3>Randomized</h3>
<p>Some problems which do not have a PTAS may admit a randomized algorithm with similar properties, a <b>polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme</b> or <b>PRAS</b>. A PRAS is an algorithm which takes an instance of an optimization or counting problem and a parameter ε &gt; 0 and, in polynomial time, produces a solution that has a <i>high probability</i> of being within a factor ε of optimal. Conventionally, "high probability" means probability greater than 3/4, though as with most probabilistic complexity classes the definition is robust to variations in this exact value. Like a PTAS, a PRAS must have running time polynomial in <i>n</i>, but not necessarily in ε; with further restrictions on the running time in ε, one can define an <b>efficient polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme</b> or <b>EPRAS</b> similar to the EPTAS, and a <b>fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme</b> or <b>FPRAS</b> similar to the FPTAS.</p>
