<h1>Bottleneck traveling salesman problem</h1>
<p>The <b>Bottleneck traveling salesman problem</b> (bottleneck TSP) is a problem in discrete or combinatorial optimization. It is stated as follows: Find the Hamiltonian cycle in a weighted graph which minimizes the weight of the most weighty edge of the cycle.</p>
<p>The problem is known to be NP-hard. The decision problem version of this, "for a given length <i>x</i>, is there a Hamiltonian cycle in a graph <i>g</i> with no edge longer than <i>x</i>?", is NP-complete.</p>
<p>In an <b>asymmetric bottleneck TSP</b>, there are cases where the weight from node <i>A</i> to <i>B</i> is different from the weight from B to A (e. g. travel time between two cities with a traffic jam in one direction).</p>
<p><b>Euclidean bottleneck TSP</b>, or planar bottleneck TSP, is the bottleneck TSP with the distance being the ordinary Euclidean distance. The problem still remains NP-hard, however many heuristics work better.</p>
<p>If the graph is a metric space then there is an efficient approximation algorithm that finds a Hamiltonian cycle with maximum edge weight being no more than twice the optimum.</p>
