<h1>BANG file</h1>
<p>A <b>BANG file</b> (balanced and nested grid file) is a point access method which divides space into a nonperiodic grid. Each spatial dimension is divided by a linear hash. Cells may intersect, and points may be distributed between them.</p>
<h2>Another meaning</h2>
<p>In some early ICL mainframe computers, a <b>bang file</b> was a temporary data storage file whose name began with a <b>!</b> character (which is sometimes nicknamed "bang") and automatically deleted when the run or user session ended.</p>
