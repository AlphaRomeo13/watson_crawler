<h1>Extreme point</h1>
<p>In mathematics, an <b>extreme point</b> of a convex set <i>S</i> in a real vector space is a point in S which does not lie in any open line segment joining two points of <i>S</i>. Intuitively, an extreme point is a "vertex" of <i>S</i>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Krein–Milman theorem states that if <i>S</i> is convex and compact in a locally convex space, then <i>S</i> is the closed convex hull of its extreme points: In particular, such a set has extreme points.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Krein–Milman theorem is stated for locally convex topological vector spaces. The next theorems are stated for Banach spaces with the Radon–Nikodym property:</p>
<ul>
<li>A theorem of Joram Lindenstrauss states that, in a Banach space with the Radon–Nikodym property, a closed and bounded set has an extreme point. (In infinite-dimensional spaces, the property of compactness is stronger than the joint properties of being closed and being bounded).</li>
<li>A theorem of Gerald Edgar states that, in a Banach space with the Radon–Nikodym property, a closed and bounded set is the closed convex hull of its extreme points.</li>
</ul>
<p>Edgar's theorem implies Lindenstrauss's theorem.</p>

<h2><i>k</i>-extreme points</h2>
<p>More generally, a point in a convex set <i>S</i> is <b><i>k</i>-extreme</b> if it lies in the interior of a <i>k</i>-dimensional convex set within <i>S</i>, but not a <i>k+1</i>-dimensional convex set within <i>S</i>. Thus, an extreme point is also a 0-extreme point. If <i>S</i> is a polytope, then the <i>k</i>-extreme points are exactly the interior points of the <i>k</i>-dimensional faces of <i>S</i>. More generally, for any convex set <i>S</i>, the <i>k</i>-extreme points are partitioned into <i>k</i>-dimensional open faces.</p>
<p>The finite-dimensional Krein-Milman theorem, which is due to Minkowski, can be quickly proved using the concept of <i>k</i>-extreme points. If <i>S</i> is closed, bounded, and <i>n</i>-dimensional, and if <i>p</i> is a point in <i>S</i>, then <i>p</i> is <i>k</i>-extreme for some <i>k</i> &lt; <i>n</i>. The theorem asserts that <i>p</i> is a convex combination of extreme points. If <i>k</i> = 0, then it's trivially true. Otherwise <i>p</i> lies on a line segment in <i>S</i> which can be maximally extended (because <i>S</i> is closed and bounded). If the endpoints of the segment are <i>q</i> and <i>r</i>, then their extreme rank must be less than that of <i>p</i>, and the theorem follows by induction.</p>
