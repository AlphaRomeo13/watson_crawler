<h1>Null graph</h1>
<p>In the mathematical field of graph theory, the term "null graph" may refer either to the order-zero graph, or alternatively, to any edgeless graph (the latter is sometimes called an "empty graph").</p>

<p>The <b>order-zero graph</b>, <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="K_0" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/a/c/fac2b25fdfc1a7980fd0d133f021f86d.png">, is the unique graph having no vertices (hence its order is zero). It follows that <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="K_0" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/a/c/fac2b25fdfc1a7980fd0d133f021f86d.png"> also has no edges. Some authors exclude <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="K_0" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/a/c/fac2b25fdfc1a7980fd0d133f021f86d.png"> from consideration as a graph (either by definition, or more simply as a matter of convenience). Whether including <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="K_0" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/a/c/fac2b25fdfc1a7980fd0d133f021f86d.png"> as a valid graph is useful depends on context. On the positive side, <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="K_0" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/a/c/fac2b25fdfc1a7980fd0d133f021f86d.png"> follows naturally from the usual set-theoretic definitions of a graph (it is the ordered pair (<i>V</i>, <i>E</i>) for which the vertex and edge sets, <i>V</i> and <i>E</i>, are both empty), in proofs it serves as a natural base case for mathematical induction, and similarly, in recursively defined data structures <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="K_0" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/a/c/fac2b25fdfc1a7980fd0d133f021f86d.png"> is useful for defining the base case for recursion (by treating the <b>null tree</b> as the child of missing edges in any non-null binary tree, every non-null binary tree has <i>exactly</i> two children). On the negative side, including <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="K_0" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/a/c/fac2b25fdfc1a7980fd0d133f021f86d.png"> as a graph requires that many well-defined formulas for graph properties include exceptions for it (for example, "counting all strongly connected components of a graph" becomes "counting all <i>non-null</i> strongly connected components of a graph"). To avoid the need for such exceptions, it is often assumed in literature that the term <i>graph</i> implies "graph with at least one vertex" unless context suggests otherwise.</p>
<p>In category theory, the order-zero graph is, according to some definitions of "category of graphs," the initial object in the category.</p>

It may be considered undirected, directed, or even both; when considered as directed, it is a directed acyclic graph. And it is both a complete graph and an edgeless graph. However, definitions for each of these graph properties will vary depending on whether context allows for <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="K_0" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/a/c/fac2b25fdfc1a7980fd0d133f021f86d.png">.</p>
