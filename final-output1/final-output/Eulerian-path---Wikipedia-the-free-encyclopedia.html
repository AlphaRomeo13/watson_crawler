<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>An <b>Eulerian trail</b>, or <b>Euler walk</b> in an undirected graph is a walk that uses each edge exactly once. If such a walk exists, the graph is called <b>traversable</b> or <b>semi-eulerian</b>.</p>
<p>An <b>Eulerian cycle</b>, <b>Eulerian circuit</b> or <b>Euler tour</b> in an undirected graph is a cycle that uses each edge exactly once. If such a cycle exists, the graph is called <b>Eulerian</b> or <b>unicursal</b>. The term "Eulerian graph" is also sometimes used in a weaker sense to denote a graph where every vertex has even degree. For finite connected graphs the two definitions are equivalent, while a possibly unconnected graph is Eulerian in the weaker sense if and only if each connected component has an Eulerian cycle.</p>
<p>For directed graphs, "path" has to be replaced with <i>directed path</i> and "cycle" with <i>directed cycle</i>.</p>
<p>The definition and properties of Eulerian trails, cycles and graphs are valid for multigraphs as well.</p>
<p>An <b>Eulerian orientation</b> of an undirected graph <i>G</i> is an assignment of a direction to each edge of <i>G</i> such that, at each vertex <i>v</i>, the indegree of <i>v</i> equals the outdegree of <i>v</i>. Such an orientation exists for any undirected graph in which every vertex has even degree, and may be found by constructing an Euler tour in each connected component of <i>G</i> and then orienting the edges according to the tour. Every Eulerian orientation of a connected graph is a strong orientation, an orientation that makes the resulting directed graph strongly connected.</p>
<h2>Properties</h2>
<ul>
<li>An undirected graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if every vertex has even degree, and all of its vertices with nonzero degree belong to a single connected component.</li>
<li>An undirected graph can be decomposed into edge-disjoint cycles if and only if all of its vertices have even degree. So, a graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if it can be decomposed into edge-disjoint cycles and its nonzero-degree vertices belong to a single connected component.</li>
<li>An undirected graph has an Eulerian trail if and only if at most two vertices have odd degree, and if all of its vertices with nonzero degree belong to a single connected component.</li>
<li>A directed graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if every vertex has equal in degree and out degree, and all of its vertices with nonzero degree belong to a single strongly connected component. Equivalently, a directed graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if it can be decomposed into edge-disjoint directed cycles and all of its vertices with nonzero degree belong to a single strongly connected component.</li>
<li>A directed graph has an Eulerian trail if and only if at most one vertex has (out-degree) − (in-degree) = 1, at most one vertex has (in-degree) − (out-degree) = 1, every other vertex has equal in-degree and out-degree, and all of its vertices with nonzero degree belong to a single connected component of the underlying undirected graph.</li>

<p><b>Fleury's algorithm</b> is an elegant but inefficient algorithm which dates to 1883. Consider a graph known to have all edges in the same component and at most two vertices of odd degree. The algorithm starts at a vertex of odd degree, or, if the graph has none, it starts with an arbitrarily chosen vertex. At each step it chooses the next edge in the path to be one whose deletion would not disconnect the graph, unless there is no such edge, in which case it picks the remaining edge left at the current vertex. It then moves to the other endpoint of that vertex and deletes the chosen edge.

<h2>Constructing Eulerian trails and circuits</h2>
<h3>Hierholzer's algorithm</h3>
<p>Hierholzer's 1873 paper provides a different method for finding Euler cycles that is more efficient than Fleury's algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose any starting vertex <i>v</i>, and follow a trail of edges from that vertex until returning to <i>v</i>. It is not possible to get stuck at any vertex other than <i>v</i>, because the even degree of all vertices ensures that, when the trail enters another vertex <i>w</i> there must be an unused edge leaving <i>w</i>. The tour formed in this way is a closed tour, but may not cover all the vertices and edges of the initial graph.</li>
<li>As long as there exists a vertex <i>u</i> that belongs to the current tour but that has adjacent edges not part of the tour, start another trail from <i>u</i>, following unused edges until returning to <i>u</i>, and join the tour formed in this way to the previous tour.</li>
</ul>
<p>By using a data structure such as a doubly linked list to maintain the set of unused edges incident to each vertex, to maintain the list of vertices on the current tour that have unused edges, and to maintain the tour itself, the individual operations of the algorithm (finding unused edges exiting each vertex, finding a new starting vertex for a tour, and connecting two tours that share a vertex) may be performed in constant time each, so the overall algorithm takes linear time.</p>
<h2>Counting Eulerian circuits</h2>
<h3>Complexity issues</h3>
<p>The number of Eulerian circuits in <i>digraphs</i> can be calculated using the so-called <b>BEST theorem</b>, named after de <b>B</b>ruijn, van Aardenne-<b>E</b>hrenfest, <b>S</b>mith and <b>T</b>utte. The formula states that the number of Eulerian circuits in a digraph is the product of certain degree factorials and the number of rooted arborescences. The latter can be computed as a determinant, by the matrix tree theorem, giving a polynomial time algorithm.</p>
<p>BEST theorem is first stated in this form in a "note added in proof" to the Aardenne-Ehrenfest and de Bruijn paper (1951). The original proof was bijective and generalized the de Bruijn sequences. It is a variation on an earlier result by Smith and Tutte (1941).</p>
<p>Counting the number of Eulerian circuits on <i>undirected</i> graphs is much more difficult. This problem is known to be #P-complete. In a positive direction, a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach, via the <i>Kotzig transformations</i> (introduced by Anton Kotzig in 1968) is believed to give a sharp approximation for the number of Eulerian circuits in a graph, though as yet there is no proof of this fact (even for graphs of bounded degree).</p>
<h3>Special cases</h3>
<p>The asymptotic formula for the number of Eulerian circuits in the complete graphs was determined by McKay and Robinson (1995):</p>
<p>A similar formula was later obtained by M.I. Isaev (2009) for complete bipartite graphs:</p>
<h2>Applications</h2>

<h2>Counting Eulerian circuits</h2>
<h3>Complexity issues</h3>
<p>The number of Eulerian circuits in <i>digraphs</i> can be calculated using the so-called <b>BEST theorem</b>, named after de <b>B</b>ruijn, van Aardenne-<b>E</b>hrenfest, <b>S</b>mith and <b>T</b>utte. The formula states that the number of Eulerian circuits in a digraph is the product of certain degree factorials and the number of rooted arborescences. The latter can be computed as a determinant, by the matrix tree theorem, giving a polynomial time algorithm.</p>
<p>BEST theorem is first stated in this form in a "note added in proof" to the Aardenne-Ehrenfest and de Bruijn paper (1951). The original proof was bijective and generalized the de Bruijn sequences. It is a variation on an earlier result by Smith and Tutte (1941).</p>
<p>Counting the number of Eulerian circuits on <i>undirected</i> graphs is much more difficult. This problem is known to be #P-complete. In a positive direction, a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach, via the <i>Kotzig transformations</i> (introduced by Anton Kotzig in 1968) is believed to give a sharp approximation for the number of Eulerian circuits in a graph, though as yet there is no proof of this fact (even for graphs of bounded degree).</p>
<h3>Special cases</h3>
<p>The asymptotic formula for the number of Eulerian circuits in the complete graphs was determined by McKay and Robinson (1995):</p>
<p>A similar formula was later obtained by M.I. Isaev (2009) for complete bipartite graphs:</p>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<p>Eulerian trails are used in bioinformatics to reconstruct the DNA sequence from its fragments. They are also used in CMOS circuit design to find an optimal logic gate ordering.</p>

<li>^   Some people reserve the terms <i>path</i> and <i>cycle</i> to mean <i>non-self-intersecting</i> path and cycle. A (potentially) self-intersecting path is known as a <b>trail</b> or an <b>open walk</b>; and a (potentially) self-intersecting cycle, a <b>circuit</b> or a <b>closed walk</b>. This ambiguity can be avoided by using the terms Eulerian trail and Eulerian circuit when self-intersection is allowed.</li>
