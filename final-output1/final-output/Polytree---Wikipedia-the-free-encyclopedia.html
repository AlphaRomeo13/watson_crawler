<h1>Polytree</h1>
<p>In mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, a <b>polytree</b> (also known as <b>oriented tree</b> or <b>singly connected network</b>) is a directed acyclic graph whose underlying undirected graph is a tree. In other words, if we replace its directed arcs with undirected edges, we obtain an undirected graph that is both connected and acyclic.</p>
<p>A polytree is an example of oriented graph.</p>
<p>The term <i>polytree</i> was coined in 1987 by Rebane and Pearl.</p>

<h2>Related structures</h2>
<p>Every directed tree (a directed acyclic graph in which there exists a single source node that has a unique path to every other node) is a polytree, but not every polytree is a directed tree. Every polytree is a multitree, a directed acyclic graph in which the subgraph reachable from any node forms a tree.</p>
<p>The reachability relationship among the nodes of a polytree forms a partial order that has order dimension at most three. If the order dimension is three, there must exist a subset of seven elements <i>x</i>, <i>y<sub>i</sub></i>, and <i>z<sub>i</sub></i> (for <i>i</i> = 0, 1, 2) such that, for each <i>i</i>, either <i>x</i> ≤ <i>y<sub>i</sub></i> ≥ <i>z<sub>i</sub></i>, or <i>x</i> ≥ <i>y<sub>i</sub></i> ≤ <i>z<sub>i</sub></i>, with these six inequalities defining the polytree structure on these seven elements.</p>
<p>A fence or zigzag poset is a special case of a polytree in which the underlying tree is a path and the edges have orientations that alternate along the path. The reachability ordering in a polytree has also been called a <i>generalized fence</i>.</p>
<h2>Enumeration</h2>
<p>The number of distinct polytrees on <i>n</i> unlabeled nodes, for <i>n</i> = 1, 2, 3, ..., is</p>
<h2>Sumner's conjecture</h2>
<p>Sumner's conjecture, named after David Sumner, states that tournaments are universal graphs for polytrees, in the sense that every tournament with 2<i>n</i> − 2 vertices contains every polytree with <i>n</i> vertices as a subgraph. Although it remains unsolved, it has been proven for all sufficiently large values of <i>n</i>.</p>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<p>Polytrees have been used as a graphical model for probabilistic reasoning. If a Bayesian network has the structure of a polytree, then belief propagation may be used to perform inference efficiently on it.</p>
<p>The contour tree of a real-valued function on a vector space is a polytree that describes the level sets of the function. The nodes of the contour tree are the level sets that pass through a critical point of the function and the edges describe contiguous sets of level sets without a critical point. The orientation of an edge is determined by the comparison between the function values on the corresponding two level sets.</p>
