<h1>Recursive language</h1>
<p>In mathematics, logic and computer science, a formal language (a set of finite sequences of symbols taken from a fixed alphabet) is called <b>recursive</b> if it is a recursive subset of the set of all possible finite sequences over the alphabet of the language. Equivalently, a formal language is recursive if there exists a total Turing machine (a Turing machine that halts for every given input) that, when given a finite sequence of symbols from the alphabet of the language as input (any string containing only characters in the language's alphabet) accepts only those that are part of the language and rejects all other strings. Recursive languages are also called <b>decidable</b>.</p>
<p>The concept of <b>decidability</b> may be extended to other models of computation. For example one may speak of languages decidable on a non-deterministic Turing machine. Therefore, whenever an ambiguity is possible, the synonym for "recursive language" used is <b>Turing-decidable language</b>, rather than simply <i>decidable</i>.</p>
<p>The class of all recursive languages is often called <b>R</b>, although this name is also used for the class RP.</p>
<p>This type of language was not defined in the Chomsky hierarchy of (Chomsky 1959). All recursive languages are also recursively enumerable. All regular, context-free and context-sensitive languages are recursive.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p>There are two equivalent major definitions for the concept of a recursive language:</p>
<ol>
<li>A recursive formal language is a recursive subset in the set of all possible words over the alphabet of the language.</li>
<li>A recursive language is a formal language for which there exists a Turing machine that, when presented with any finite input string, halts and accept if the string is in the language, and halts and rejects otherwise. The Turing machine always halts: it is known as a decider and is said to <i>decide</i> the recursive language.</li>
</ol>
<p>By the second definition, any decision problem can be shown to be decidable by exhibiting an algorithm for it that terminates on all inputs. An undecidable problem is a problem that is not decidable.</p>
<h2>Closure properties</h2>
<p>Recursive languages are closed under the following operations. That is, if <i>L</i> and <i>P</i> are two recursive languages, then the following languages are recursive as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Kleene star <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="L^*" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/9/0/89084328ea912bfa88d4650df9bf303f.png"></li>
<li>The image φ(L) under an e-free homomorphism φ</li>
<li>The concatenation <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="L \circ P" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/f/7/8f78d7c8d1bfae1e5563b0301978c0da.png"></li>
<li>The union <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="L \cup P" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/1/d/71d751b956fa9744a4967d2a915c6886.png"></li>
<li>The intersection <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="L \cap P" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/9/b/c9b6733cf2b2d4750a098bce5aa38968.png"></li>
<li>The complement of <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="L" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/2/0/d20caec3b48a1eef164cb4ca81ba2587.png"></li>
<li>The set difference <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="L - P" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/4/0/0404e456638a308e551ad29d31f0f95a.png"></li>
</ul>
<p>The last property follows from the fact that the set difference can be expressed in terms of intersection and complement.</p>
