<h1>Algorithm</h1>
<p>In mathematics and computer science, an <b>algorithm</b> (<img alt="Listen" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Speakerlink-new.svg/11px-Speakerlink-new.svg.png" width="11" height="11" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Speakerlink-new.svg/17px-Speakerlink-new.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Speakerlink-new.svg/22px-Speakerlink-new.svg.png 2x" data-file-width="11" data-file-height="11">/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ <i><b>AL</b>-gə-ri-dhəm</i>) is a step-by-step procedure for calculations. Algorithms are used for calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning.</p>
<p>An algorithm is an effective method expressed as a finite list of well-defined instructions for calculating a function. Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output" and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.</p>
<p>Though al-Khwārizmī's <i>algorism</i> referred to the rules of performing arithmetic using Hindu–Arabic numerals and the systematic solution of linear and quadratic equations, a partial formalization of what would become the modern <i>algorithm</i> began with attempts to solve the Entscheidungsproblem (the "decision problem") posed by David Hilbert in 1928. Subsequent formalizations were framed as attempts to define "effective calculability" or "effective method"; those formalizations included the Gödel–Herbrand–Kleene recursive functions of 1930, 1934 and 1935, Alonzo Church's lambda calculus of 1936, Emil Post's "Formulation 1" of 1936, and Alan Turing's Turing machines of 1936–7 and 1939. Giving a formal definition of algorithms, corresponding to the intuitive notion, remains a challenging problem.</p>

<h2>Word origin</h2>
<p>'Algorithm' stems from the name of a Latin translation of a book written by al-Khwārizmī, a Persian mathematician, astronomer and geographer, whose work built upon that of the 7th-century Indian mathematician Brahmagupta. Al-Khwarizmi wrote a book titled <i>On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals</i> in about 825 AD, and was principally responsible for spreading the Indian system of numeration throughout the Middle East and Europe. It was translated into Latin as <i>Algoritmi de numero Indorum</i> (in English, "Al-Khwarizmi on the Hindu Art of Reckoning"). The term "Algoritmi" in the title of the book led to the term "algorithm".</p>
<h2>Informal definition</h2>
<p>An informal definition could be "a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations." which would include all computer programs, including programs that do not perform numeric calculations. Generally, a program is only an algorithm if it stops eventually.</p>
<p>A prototypical example of an algorithm is Euclid's algorithm to determine the maximum common divisor of two integers; an example (there are others) is described by the flow chart above and as an example in a later section.</p>
<p>Boolos &amp; Jeffrey (1974, 1999) offer an informal meaning of the word in the following quotation:</p>
<p>No human being can write fast enough, or long enough, or small enough† ( †"smaller and smaller without limit ...you'd be trying to write on molecules, on atoms, on electrons") to list all members of an enumerably infinite set by writing out their names, one after another, in some notation. But humans can do something equally useful, in the case of certain enumerably infinite sets: They can give <i>explicit instructions for determining the <b>n</b>th member of the set</i>, for arbitrary finite <i>n</i>. Such instructions are to be given quite explicitly, in a form in which <i>they could be followed by a computing machine</i>, or by a <i>human who is capable of carrying out only very elementary operations on symbols.</i></p>
<p>An "enumerably infinite set" is one whose elements can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the integers. Thus, Boolos and Jeffrey are saying that an algorithm implies instructions for a process that "creates" output integers from an <i>arbitrary</i> "input" integer or integers that, in theory, can be arbitrarily large. Thus an algorithm can be an algebraic equation such as <i>y = m + n</i>—two arbitrary "input variables" <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> that produce an output <i>y</i>. But various authors' attempts to define the notion indicate that the word implies much more than this, something on the order of (for the addition example):</p>
<p>The concept of <i>algorithm</i> is also used to define the notion of decidability. That notion is central for explaining how formal systems come into being starting from a small set of axioms and rules. In logic, the time that an algorithm requires to complete cannot be measured, as it is not apparently related with our customary physical dimension. From such uncertainties, that characterize ongoing work, stems the unavailability of a definition of <i>algorithm</i> that suits both concrete (in some sense) and abstract usage of the term.</p>
<h2>Formalization</h2>
<p>Algorithms are essential to the way computers process data. Many computer programs contain algorithms that detail the specific instructions a computer should perform (in a specific order) to carry out a specified task, such as calculating employees' paychecks or printing students' report cards. Thus, an algorithm can be considered to be any sequence of operations that can be simulated by a Turing-complete system. Authors who assert this thesis include Minsky (1967), Savage (1987) and Gurevich (2000):</p>
<p>Minsky: "But we will also maintain, with Turing . . . that any procedure which could "naturally" be called effective, can in fact be realized by a (simple) machine. Although this may seem extreme, the arguments . . . in its favor are hard to refute".</p>
<p>Gurevich: "...Turing's informal argument in favor of his thesis justifies a stronger thesis: every algorithm can be simulated by a Turing machine ... according to Savage [1987], an algorithm is a computational process defined by a Turing machine".</p>
<p>Typically, when an algorithm is associated with processing information, data is read from an input source, written to an output device, and/or stored for further processing. Stored data is regarded as part of the internal state of the entity performing the algorithm. In practice, the state is stored in one or more data structures.</p>
<p>For some such computational process, the algorithm must be rigorously defined: specified in the way it applies in all possible circumstances that could arise. That is, any conditional steps must be systematically dealt with, case-by-case; the criteria for each case must be clear (and computable).</p>
<p>Because an algorithm is a precise list of precise steps, the order of computation is always critical to the functioning of the algorithm. Instructions are usually assumed to be listed explicitly, and are described as starting "from the top" and going "down to the bottom", an idea that is described more formally by <i>flow of control</i>.</p>
<p>So far, this discussion of the formalization of an algorithm has assumed the premises of imperative programming. This is the most common conception, and it attempts to describe a task in discrete, "mechanical" means. Unique to this conception of formalized algorithms is the assignment operation, setting the value of a variable. It derives from the intuition of "memory" as a scratchpad. There is an example below of such an assignment.</p>
<p>For some alternate conceptions of what constitutes an algorithm see functional programming and logic programming.</p>
<h3>Expressing algorithms</h3>
<p>Algorithms can be expressed in many kinds of notation, including natural languages, pseudocode, flowcharts, drakon-charts, programming languages or control tables (processed by interpreters). Natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous, and are rarely used for complex or technical algorithms. Pseudocode, flowcharts, drakon-charts and control tables are structured ways to express algorithms that avoid many of the ambiguities common in natural language statements. Programming languages are primarily intended for expressing algorithms in a form that can be executed by a computer, but are often used as a way to define or document algorithms.</p>
<p>There is a wide variety of representations possible and one can express a given Turing machine program as a sequence of machine tables (see more at finite state machine, state transition table and control table), as flowcharts and drakon-charts (see more at state diagram), or as a form of rudimentary machine code or assembly code called "sets of quadruples" (see more at Turing machine).</p>
<p>Representations of algorithms can be classed into three accepted levels of Turing machine description:</p>
<p>For an example of the simple algorithm "Add m+n" described in all three levels, see Algorithm examples.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>Most algorithms are intended to be implemented as computer programs. However, algorithms are also implemented by other means, such as in a biological neural network (for example, the human brain implementing arithmetic or an insect looking for food), in an electrical circuit, or in a mechanical device.</p>
<h2>Computer algorithms</h2>
<p>In computer systems, an algorithm is basically an instance of logic written in software by software developers to be effective for the intended "target" computer(s) for the target machines to produce <i>output</i> from given <i>input</i> (perhaps null). An optimal algorithm, even running in old hardware, would produce faster results than an non optimal (higher time complexity) algorithm for the same purpose, running in more efficient hardware; that is why the algorithms, like computer hardware, are considered technology.</p>
<p><i>"Elegant" (compact) programs, "good" (fast) programs</i> : The notion of "simplicity and elegance" appears informally in Knuth and precisely in Chaitin:</p>
<p>Chaitin prefaces his definition with: "I'll show you can't prove that a program is 'elegant'"—such a proof would solve the Halting problem (ibid).</p>
<p><i>Algorithm versus function computable by an algorithm</i>: For a given function multiple algorithms may exist. This is true, even without expanding the available instruction set available to the programmer. Rogers observes that "It is . . . important to distinguish between the notion of <i>algorithm</i>, i.e. procedure and the notion of <i>function computable by algorithm</i>, i.e. mapping yielded by procedure. The same function may have several different algorithms".</p>
<p>Unfortunately there may be a tradeoff between goodness (speed) and elegance (compactness)—an elegant program may take more steps to complete a computation than one less elegant. An example that uses Euclid's algorithm appears below.</p>
<p><i>Computers (and computors), models of computation</i>: A computer (or human "computor") is a restricted type of machine, a "discrete deterministic mechanical device" that blindly follows its instructions. Melzak's and Lambek's primitive models reduced this notion to four elements: (i) discrete, distinguishable <i>locations</i>, (ii) discrete, indistinguishable <i>counters</i> (iii) an agent, and (iv) a list of instructions that are <i>effective</i> relative to the capability of the agent.</p>
<p>Minsky describes a more congenial variation of Lambek's "abacus" model in his "Very Simple Bases for Computability". Minsky's machine proceeds sequentially through its five (or six depending on how one counts) instructions unless either a conditional IF–THEN GOTO or an unconditional GOTO changes program flow out of sequence. Besides HALT, Minsky's machine includes three <i>assignment</i> (replacement, substitution) operations: ZERO (e.g. the contents of location replaced by 0: L ← 0), SUCCESSOR (e.g. L ← L+1), and DECREMENT (e.g. L ← L − 1). Rarely must a programmer write "code" with such a limited instruction set. But Minsky shows (as do Melzak and Lambek) that his machine is Turing complete with only four general <i>types</i> of instructions: conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment/replacement/substitution, and HALT.</p>
<p><i>Simulation of an algorithm: computer (computor) language</i>: Knuth advises the reader that "the best way to learn an algorithm is to try it . . . immediately take pen and paper and work through an example". But what about a simulation or execution of the real thing? The programmer must translate the algorithm into a language that the simulator/computer/computor can <i>effectively</i> execute. Stone gives an example of this: when computing the roots of a quadratic equation the computor must know how to take a square root. If they don't then for the algorithm to be effective it must provide a set of rules for extracting a square root.</p>
<p>This means that the programmer must know a "language" that is effective relative to the target computing agent (computer/computor).</p>
<p>But what model should be used for the simulation? Van Emde Boas observes "even if we base complexity theory on abstract instead of concrete machines, arbitrariness of the choice of a model remains. It is at this point that the notion of <i>simulation</i> enters". When speed is being measured, the instruction set matters. For example, the subprogram in Euclid's algorithm to compute the remainder would execute much faster if the programmer had a "modulus" (division) instruction available rather than just subtraction (or worse: just Minsky's "decrement").</p>
<p><i>Structured programming, canonical structures</i>: Per the Church-Turing thesis any algorithm can be computed by a model known to be Turing complete, and per Minsky's demonstrations Turing completeness requires only four instruction types—conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment, HALT. Kemeny and Kurtz observe that while "undisciplined" use of unconditional GOTOs and conditional IF-THEN GOTOs can result in "spaghetti code" a programmer can write structured programs using these instructions; on the other hand "it is also possible, and not too hard, to write badly structured programs in a structured language". Tausworthe augments the three Böhm-Jacopini canonical structures: SEQUENCE, IF-THEN-ELSE, and WHILE-DO, with two more: DO-WHILE and CASE. An additional benefit of a structured program is that it lends itself to proofs of correctness using mathematical induction.</p>
<p><i>Canonical flowchart symbols</i>: The graphical aide called a flowchart offers a way to describe and document an algorithm (and a computer program of one). Like program flow of a Minsky machine, a flowchart always starts at the top of a page and proceeds down. Its primary symbols are only 4: the directed arrow showing program flow, the rectangle (SEQUENCE, GOTO), the diamond (IF-THEN-ELSE), and the dot (OR-tie). The Böhm-Jacopini canonical structures are made of these primitive shapes. Sub-structures can "nest" in rectangles but only if a single exit occurs from the superstructure. The symbols and their use to build the canonical structures are shown in the diagram.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Algorithm example</h3>
<p>One of the simplest algorithms is to find the largest number in a list of numbers of random order. Finding solution requires looking at every number in the list. From this follows a simple algorithm, which can be stated in a high-level description English prose, as:</p>
<p><i>High-level description:</i></p>
<ol>
<li>If there are no numbers in the set then there is no highest number.</li>
<li>Assume the first number in the set is the largest number in the set.</li>
<li>For each remaining number in the set: if this number is larger than the current largest number, consider this number to be the largest number in the set.</li>
<li>When there are no numbers left in the set to iterate over, consider the current largest number to be the largest number of the set.</li>
</ol>
<p><i>(Quasi-)formal description:</i> Written in prose but much closer to the high-level language of a computer program, the following is the more formal coding of the algorithm in pseudocode or pidgin code:</p>
<p>WHATSON? e43a31c1-ab03-45d1-9cd1-fbe47bb6e03b</p>

      <i>largest</i> ← <i>item</i>
  <b>return</b> <i>largest</i>
</pre>
<ul>
<li><small>"←" is a shorthand for "changes to". For instance, "<i>largest</i> ← <i>item</i>" means that the value of <i>largest</i> changes to the value of <i>item</i>.</small></li>
<li><small>"<b>return</b>" terminates the algorithm and outputs the value that follows.</small></li>
</ul>
<h3>Euclid’s algorithm</h3>
<p>Euclid’s algorithm appears as Proposition II in Book VII ("Elementary Number Theory") of his <i>Elements</i>. Euclid poses the problem: "Given two numbers not prime to one another, to find their greatest common measure". He defines "A number [to be] a multitude composed of units": a counting number, a positive integer not including 0. And to "measure" is to place a shorter measuring length <i>s</i> successively (<i>q</i> times) along longer length <i>l</i> until the remaining portion <i>r</i> is less than the shorter length <i>s</i>. In modern words, remainder <i>r = l − q*s</i>, <i>q</i> being the quotient, or remainder <i>r</i> is the "modulus", the integer-fractional part left over after the division.</p>
<p>For Euclid’s method to succeed, the starting lengths must satisfy two requirements: (i) the lengths must not be 0, AND (ii) the subtraction must be “proper”, a test must guarantee that the smaller of the two numbers is subtracted from the larger (alternately, the two can be equal so their subtraction yields 0).</p>
<p>Euclid's original proof adds a third: the two lengths are not prime to one another. Euclid stipulated this so that he could construct a reductio ad absurdum proof that the two numbers' common measure is in fact the <i>greatest</i>. While Nicomachus' algorithm is the same as Euclid's, when the numbers are prime to one another it yields the number "1" for their common measure. So to be precise the following is really Nicomachus' algorithm.</p>
<p>WHATSON? fe3697bd-baa1-4706-98c1-57de3b3f09e6</p>
<pre>
 1599 = 650*2 + 299 650 = 299*2 + 52
 299 = 52*5 + 39
 52 = 39*1 + 13
 39 = 13*3 + 0
</pre>
<h4>Computer language for Euclid's algorithm</h4>
<p>Only a few instruction <i>types</i> are required to execute Euclid's algorithm—some logical tests (conditional GOTO), unconditional GOTO, assignment (replacement), and subtraction.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <i>location</i> is symbolized by upper case letter(s), e.g. S, A, etc.</li>
<li>The varying quantity (number) in a location is written in lower case letter(s) and (usually) associated with the location's name. For example, location L at the start might contain the number <i>l</i> = 3009.</li>
</ul>
<h4>An inelegant program for Euclid's algorithm</h4>
<p>The following algorithm is framed as Knuth's 4-step version of Euclid's and Nichomachus', but rather than using division to find the remainder it uses successive subtractions of the shorter length <i>s</i> from the remaining length <i>r</i> until <i>r</i> is less than <i>s</i>. The high-level description, shown in boldface, is adapted from Knuth 1973:2–4:</p>

<h4>An elegant program for Euclid's algorithm</h4>
<p>The following version of Euclid's algorithm requires only 6 core instructions to do what 13 are required to do by "Inelegant"; worse, "Inelegant" requires more <i>types</i> of instructions. The flowchart of "Elegant" can be found at the top of this article. In the (unstructured) Basic language the steps are numbered, and the instruction LET [] = [] is the assignment instruction symbolized by ←.</p>
<p>WHATSON? e45c8046-6117-4e96-a256-8fb035b1bda4</p>

<p><i>How "Elegant" works</i>: In place of an outer "Euclid loop", "Elegant" shifts back and forth between two "co-loops", an A &gt; B loop that computes A ← A − B, and a B ≤ A loop that computes B ← B − A. This works because, when at last the minuend M is less than or equal to the subtrahend S ( Difference = Minuend − Subtrahend), the minuend can become <i>s</i> (the new measuring length) and the subtrahend can become the new <i>r</i> (the length to be measured); in other words the "sense" of the subtraction reverses.</p>
<h3>Testing the Euclid algorithms</h3>
<p>Does an algorithm do what its author wants it to do? A few test cases usually suffice to confirm core functionality. One source uses 3009 and 884. Knuth suggested 40902, 24140. Another interesting case is the two relatively prime numbers 14157 and 5950.</p>
<p>But exceptional cases must be identified and tested. Will "Inelegant" perform properly when R &gt; S, S &gt; R, R = S? Ditto for "Elegant": B &gt; A, A &gt; B, A = B? (Yes to all). What happens when one number is zero, both numbers are zero? ("Inelegant" computes forever in all cases; "Elegant" computes forever when A = 0.) What happens if <i>negative</i> numbers are entered? Fractional numbers? If the input numbers, i.e. the domain of the function computed by the algorithm/program, is to include only positive integers including zero, then the failures at zero indicate that the algorithm (and the program that instantiates it) is a partial function rather than a total function. A notable failure due to exceptions is the Ariane V rocket failure.</p>
<p><i>Proof of program correctness by use of mathematical induction</i>: Knuth demonstrates the application of mathematical induction to an "extended" version of Euclid's algorithm, and he proposes "a general method applicable to proving the validity of any algorithm". Tausworthe proposes that a measure of the complexity of a program be the length of its correctness proof.</p>
<h3>Measuring and improving the Euclid algorithms</h3>
<p><i>Elegance (compactness) versus goodness (speed)</i>: With only 6 core instructions, "Elegant" is the clear winner compared to "Inelegant" at 13 instructions. However, "Inelegant" is <i>faster</i> (it arrives at HALT in fewer steps). Algorithm analysis indicates why this is the case: "Elegant" does <i>two</i> conditional tests in every subtraction loop, whereas "Inelegant" only does one. As the algorithm (usually) requires many loop-throughs, <i>on average</i> much time is wasted doing a "B = 0?" test that is needed only after the remainder is computed.</p>
<p><i>Can the algorithms be improved?</i>: Once the programmer judges a program "fit" and "effective"—that is, it computes the function intended by its author—then the question becomes, can it be improved?</p>
<p>The compactness of "Inelegant" can be improved by the elimination of 5 steps. But Chaitin proved that compacting an algorithm cannot be automated by a generalized algorithm; rather, it can only be done heuristically, i.e. by exhaustive search (examples to be found at Busy beaver), trial and error, cleverness, insight, application of inductive reasoning, etc. Observe that steps 4, 5 and 6 are repeated in steps 11, 12 and 13. Comparison with "Elegant" provides a hint that these steps together with steps 2 and 3 can be eliminated. This reduces the number of core instructions from 13 to 8, which makes it "more elegant" than "Elegant" at 9 steps.</p>
<p>The speed of "Elegant" can be improved by moving the B=0? test outside of the two subtraction loops. This change calls for the addition of 3 instructions (B=0?, A=0?, GOTO). Now "Elegant" computes the example-numbers faster; whether for any given A, B and R, S this is always the case would require a detailed analysis.</p>
<h2>Algorithmic analysis</h2>
<p>It is frequently important to know how much of a particular resource (such as time or storage) is theoretically required for a given algorithm. Methods have been developed for the analysis of algorithms to obtain such quantitative answers (estimates); for example, the sorting algorithm above has a time requirement of O(<i>n</i>), using the big O notation with <i>n</i> as the length of the list. At all times the algorithm only needs to remember two values: the largest number found so far, and its current position in the input list. Therefore it is said to have a space requirement of <i>O(1)</i>, if the space required to store the input numbers is not counted, or O(<i>n</i>) if it is counted.</p>
<p>Different algorithms may complete the same task with a different set of instructions in less or more time, space, or 'effort' than others. For example, a binary search algorithm usually outperforms a brute force sequential search when used for table lookups on sorted lists.</p>
<h3>Formal versus empirical</h3>
<p>The analysis and study of algorithms is a discipline of computer science, and is often practiced abstractly without the use of a specific programming language or implementation. In this sense, algorithm analysis resembles other mathematical disciplines in that it focuses on the underlying properties of the algorithm and not on the specifics of any particular implementation. Usually pseudocode is used for analysis as it is the simplest and most general representation. However, ultimately, most algorithms are usually implemented on particular hardware / software platforms and their algorithmic efficiency is eventually put to the test using real code. For the solution of a "one off" problem, the efficiency of a particular algorithm may not have significant consequences (unless n is extremely large) but for algorithms designed for fast interactive, commercial or long life scientific usage it may be critical. Scaling from small n to large n frequently exposes inefficient algorithms that are otherwise benign.</p>
<p>Empirical testing is useful because it may uncover unexpected interactions that affect performance. Benchmarks may be used to compare before/after potential improvements to an algorithm after program optimization.</p>
<h3>Execution efficiency</h3>
<p>To illustrate the potential improvements possible even in well established algorithms, a recent significant innovation, relating to FFT algorithms (used heavily in the field of image processing), can decrease processing time up to 1,000 times for applications like medical imaging. In general, speed improvements depend on special properties of the problem, which are very common in practical applications. Speedups of this magnitude enable computing devices that make extensive use of image processing (like digital cameras and medical equipment) to consume less power.</p>
<h2>Classification</h2>
<p>There are various ways to classify algorithms, each with its own merits.</p>
<h3>By implementation</h3>
<p>One way to classify algorithms is by implementation means.</p>
<h3>By design paradigm</h3>
<p>Another way of classifying algorithms is by their design methodology or paradigm. There is a certain number of paradigms, each different from the other. Furthermore, each of these categories include many different types of algorithms. Some common paradigms are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Monte Carlo algorithms return a correct answer with high-probability. E.g. RP is the subclass of these that run in polynomial time)</li>
<li>Las Vegas algorithms always return the correct answer, but their running time is only probabilistically bound, e.g. ZPP.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Optimization problems</h3>
<p>For optimization problems there is a more specific classification of algorithms; an algorithm for such problems may fall into one or more of the general categories described above as well as into one of the following:</p>
<h3>By field of study</h3>
<p>Every field of science has its own problems and needs efficient algorithms. Related problems in one field are often studied together. Some example classes are search algorithms, sorting algorithms, merge algorithms, numerical algorithms, graph algorithms, string algorithms, computational geometric algorithms, combinatorial algorithms, medical algorithms, machine learning, cryptography, data compression algorithms and parsing techniques.</p>
<p>Fields tend to overlap with each other, and algorithm advances in one field may improve those of other, sometimes completely unrelated, fields. For example, dynamic programming was invented for optimization of resource consumption in industry, but is now used in solving a broad range of problems in many fields.</p>
<h3>By complexity</h3>
<p>Algorithms can be classified by the amount of time they need to complete compared to their input size. There is a wide variety: some algorithms complete in linear time relative to input size, some do so in an exponential amount of time or even worse, and some never halt. Additionally, some problems may have multiple algorithms of differing complexity, while other problems might have no algorithms or no known efficient algorithms. There are also mappings from some problems to other problems. Owing to this, it was found to be more suitable to classify the problems themselves instead of the algorithms into equivalence classes based on the complexity of the best possible algorithms for them.</p>
<p>Burgin (2005, p. 24) uses a generalized definition of algorithms that relaxes the common requirement that the output of the algorithm that computes a function must be determined after a finite number of steps. He defines a super-recursive class of algorithms as "a class of algorithms in which it is possible to compute functions not computable by any Turing machine" (Burgin 2005, p. 107). This is closely related to the study of methods of hypercomputation.</p>
<h3>By evaluative type</h3>
<p>To maintain balance while integrating machines into society, one may classify algorithms by the types of evaluation they perform. A number of philosophers have hypothesized that societies benefit from evaluative diversity much as they benefit from diversity of gender and blood type (e.g. Dean 2012, Sober &amp; Wilson 1998, Hertzke &amp; McConkey 1998, and Bellah 1985). Technology could threaten those moral ecosystems like an invasive species if it skews the diversity mix. Wallach &amp; Allen (2008) classified decision-making algorithms into three evaluative types: Bottom-up algorithms make judgments unpredictable to their programmers (e.g. evolving software). All others (top-down) were divided into deontological (which can be relied upon to implement programmed rules) vs. consequentialist (which can be relied upon to maximize a programmed measure). As examples, a standard calculator would be deontological, while machine learning for trading stocks would be consequentialist.</p>
<p>Santos-Lang renamed the deontological and consequentialist classes "institutional" and "negotiator" respectively to avoid the implication that all deontological and consequentialist theories of ethics can be implemented as algorithms, and split the bottom-up class into "gadfly" (algorithms which are unpredictable because of their use of randomness generators) vs. "relational" (algorithms which are unpredictable because of network effects). A mutator in evolutionary computation would be an example of a gadfly, while a class 3 or 4 cellular automaton would be an example of a relational machine. Santos-Lang noted that algorithms often have subcomponents of other types. For example, a stock trading negotiator may implement a genetic algorithm, and thus contain gadfly mutators, and mutators may in turn have institutional and relational subcomponents, all computation being relational at the level of underlying chemistry (Santos-Lang 2014).</p>
<h2>Continuous algorithms</h2>
<p>The adjective "continuous" when applied to the word "algorithm" can mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>An algorithm operating on data that represents continuous quantities, even though this data is represented by discrete approximations—such algorithms are studied in numerical analysis; or</li>
<li>An algorithm in the form of a differential equation that operates continuously on the data, running on an analog computer.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Legal issues</h2>
<p>Algorithms, by themselves, are not usually patentable. In the United States, a claim consisting solely of simple manipulations of abstract concepts, numbers, or signals does not constitute "processes" (USPTO 2006), and hence algorithms are not patentable (as in Gottschalk v. Benson). However, practical applications of algorithms are sometimes patentable. For example, in Diamond v. Diehr, the application of a simple feedback algorithm to aid in the curing of synthetic rubber was deemed patentable. The patenting of software is highly controversial, and there are highly criticized patents involving algorithms, especially data compression algorithms, such as Unisys' LZW patent.</p>
<p>Additionally, some cryptographic algorithms have export restrictions (see export of cryptography).</p>
<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>The word <i>"Algorithm"</i>, or <i>"Algorism"</i> in some other writing versions, comes from the name al-Khwārizmī, pronounced in classical Arabic as Al-Khwarithmi. Al-Khwārizmī (Persian: خوارزمي‎, c. 780-850) was a Persian mathematician, astronomer, geographer and a scholar in the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, whose name means <i>"the native of Khwarezm"</i>, a city that was part of the Greater Iran during his era and now is in modern day Uzbekistan. About 825, he wrote a treatise in the Arabic language, which was translated into Latin in the 12th century under the title <i>Algoritmi de numero Indorum</i>. This title means "Algoritmi on the numbers of the Indians", where "Algoritmi" was the translator's Latinization of Al-Khwarizmi's name. Al-Khwarizmi was the most widely read mathematician in Europe in the late Middle Ages, primarily through his other book, the Algebra. In late medieval Latin, <i>algorismus</i>, the corruption of his name, simply meant the "decimal number system" that is still the meaning of modern English algorism. In 17th-century French the word's form, but not its meaning, changed to <i>algorithme</i>. English adopted the French very soon afterwards, but it wasn't until the late 19th century that "Algorithm" took on the meaning that it has in modern English.</p>
<p>Alternative etymology claims origin from the terms <i>algebra</i> in its late medieval sense of "Arabic arithmetics" and <i>arithmos</i> the Greek term for number (thus literally meaning "Arabic numbers" or "Arabic calculation"). Algorithms of Al-Kharizmi's works are not meant in their modern sense but as a type of repetitive calculus (here is to mention that his fundamental work known as algebra was originally titled "The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing" describing types of repetitive calculation and quadratic equations). In that sense, algorithms were known in Europe long before Al-Kharizmi. The oldest algorithm known today is the Euclidean algorithm (see also Extended Euclidean algorithm). Before the coining of the term <i>algorithm</i> the Greeks were calling them <i>anthyphairesis</i> literally meaning anti-subtraction or reciprocal subtraction (further reading here and here). Algorithms were known to the Greeks centuries before Euclid. Instead of the word <i>algebra</i> the Greeks were using the term <i>arithmetica</i> (ἀριθμητική, i.e. in Diophantus' works the so-called "father of Algebra" - see also Wikipedia's articles Diophantine equation and Eudoxos).</p>
<h2>History: Development of the notion of "algorithm"</h2>
<h3>Origin</h3>
<p>The word algorithm comes from the name of the 9th century Persian mathematician Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi, whose work built upon that of the 7th-century Indian mathematician Brahmagupta. The word algorism originally referred only to the rules of performing arithmetic using Hindu–Arabic numerals but evolved via European Latin translation of Al-Khwarizmi's name into algorithm by the 18th century. The use of the word evolved to include all definite procedures for solving problems or performing tasks.</p>
<h3>Discrete and distinguishable symbols</h3>
<p><b>Tally-marks</b>: To keep track of their flocks, their sacks of grain and their money the ancients used tallying: accumulating stones or marks scratched on sticks, or making discrete symbols in clay. Through the Babylonian and Egyptian use of marks and symbols, eventually Roman numerals and the abacus evolved (Dilson, p. 16–41). Tally marks appear prominently in unary numeral system arithmetic used in Turing machine and Post–Turing machine computations.</p>
<h3>Manipulation of symbols as "place holders" for numbers: algebra</h3>
<p>The work of the ancient Greek geometers (Euclidean algorithm), the Indian mathematician Brahmagupta, and the Persian mathematician Al-Khwarizmi (from whose name the terms "algorism" and "algorithm" are derived), and Western European mathematicians culminated in Leibniz's notion of the calculus ratiocinator (ca 1680):</p>
<p>A good century and a half ahead of his time, Leibniz proposed an algebra of logic, an algebra that would specify the rules for manipulating logical concepts in the manner that ordinary algebra specifies the rules for manipulating numbers.</p>
<h3>Mechanical contrivances with discrete states</h3>
<p><i>The clock</i>: Bolter credits the invention of the weight-driven clock as "The key invention [of Europe in the Middle Ages]", in particular the verge escapement that provides us with the tick and tock of a mechanical clock. "The accurate automatic machine" led immediately to "mechanical automata" beginning in the 13th century and finally to "computational machines"—the difference engine and analytical engines of Charles Babbage and Countess Ada Lovelace, mid-19th century. Lovelace is credited with the first creation of an algorithm intended for processing on a computer - Babbage's analytical engine, the first device considered a real Turing-complete computer instead of just a calculator - and is sometimes called "history's first programmer" as a result, though a full implementation of Babbage's second device would not be realized until decades after her lifetime.</p>
<p><i>Logical machines 1870—Stanley Jevons' "logical abacus" and "logical machine"</i>: The technical problem was to reduce Boolean equations when presented in a form similar to what are now known as Karnaugh maps. Jevons (1880) describes first a simple "abacus" of "slips of wood furnished with pins, contrived so that any part or class of the [logical] combinations can be picked out mechanically . . . More recently however I have reduced the system to a completely mechanical form, and have thus embodied the whole of the indirect process of inference in what may be called a <i>Logical Machine</i>" His machine came equipped with "certain moveable wooden rods" and "at the foot are 21 keys like those of a piano [etc] . . .". With this machine he could analyze a "syllogism or any other simple logical argument".</p>
<p>This machine he displayed in 1870 before the Fellows of the Royal Society. Another logician John Venn, however, in his 1881 <i>Symbolic Logic</i>, turned a jaundiced eye to this effort: "I have no high estimate myself of the interest or importance of what are sometimes called logical machines ... it does not seem to me that any contrivances at present known or likely to be discovered really deserve the name of logical machines"; see more at Algorithm characterizations. But not to be outdone he too presented "a plan somewhat analogous, I apprehend, to Prof. Jevon's <i>abacus</i> ... [And] [a]gain, corresponding to Prof. Jevons's logical machine, the following contrivance may be described. I prefer to call it merely a logical-diagram machine ... but I suppose that it could do very completely all that can be rationally expected of any logical machine".</p>
<p><i>Jacquard loom, Hollerith punch cards, telegraphy and telephony—the electromechanical relay</i>: Bell and Newell (1971) indicate that the Jacquard loom (1801), precursor to Hollerith cards (punch cards, 1887), and "telephone switching technologies" were the roots of a tree leading to the development of the first computers. By the mid-19th century the telegraph, the precursor of the telephone, was in use throughout the world, its discrete and distinguishable encoding of letters as "dots and dashes" a common sound. By the late 19th century the ticker tape (ca 1870s) was in use, as was the use of Hollerith cards in the 1890 U.S. census. Then came the teleprinter (ca. 1910) with its punched-paper use of Baudot code on tape.</p>
<p><i>Telephone-switching networks</i> of electromechanical relays (invented 1835) was behind the work of George Stibitz (1937), the inventor of the digital adding device. As he worked in Bell Laboratories, he observed the "burdensome' use of mechanical calculators with gears. "He went home one evening in 1937 intending to test his idea... When the tinkering was over, Stibitz had constructed a binary adding device".</p>
<p>Davis (2000) observes the particular importance of the electromechanical relay (with its two "binary states" <i>open</i> and <i>closed</i>):</p>
<h3>Mathematics during the 19th century up to the mid-20th century</h3>
<p><i>Symbols and rules</i>: In rapid succession the mathematics of George Boole (1847, 1854), Gottlob Frege (1879), and Giuseppe Peano (1888–1889) reduced arithmetic to a sequence of symbols manipulated by rules. Peano's <i>The principles of arithmetic, presented by a new method</i> (1888) was "the first attempt at an axiomatization of mathematics in a symbolic language".</p>
<p>But Heijenoort gives Frege (1879) this kudos: Frege's is "perhaps the most important single work ever written in logic. ... in which we see a " 'formula language', that is a <i>lingua characterica</i>, a language written with special symbols, "for pure thought", that is, free from rhetorical embellishments ... constructed from specific symbols that are manipulated according to definite rules". The work of Frege was further simplified and amplified by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell in their Principia Mathematica (1910–1913).</p>
<p><i>The paradoxes</i>: At the same time a number of disturbing paradoxes appeared in the literature, in particular the Burali-Forti paradox (1897), the Russell paradox (1902–03), and the Richard Paradox. The resultant considerations led to Kurt Gödel's paper (1931)—he specifically cites the paradox of the liar—that completely reduces rules of recursion to numbers.</p>
<p><i>Effective calculability</i>: In an effort to solve the Entscheidungsproblem defined precisely by Hilbert in 1928, mathematicians first set about to define what was meant by an "effective method" or "effective calculation" or "effective calculability" (i.e., a calculation that would succeed). In rapid succession the following appeared: Alonzo Church, Stephen Kleene and J.B. Rosser's λ-calculus a finely honed definition of "general recursion" from the work of Gödel acting on suggestions of Jacques Herbrand (cf. Gödel's Princeton lectures of 1934) and subsequent simplifications by Kleene. Church's proof that the Entscheidungsproblem was unsolvable, Emil Post's definition of effective calculability as a worker mindlessly following a list of instructions to move left or right through a sequence of rooms and while there either mark or erase a paper or observe the paper and make a yes-no decision about the next instruction. Alan Turing's proof of that the Entscheidungsproblem was unsolvable by use of his "a- [automatic-] machine"—in effect almost identical to Post's "formulation", J. Barkley Rosser's definition of "effective method" in terms of "a machine". S. C. Kleene's proposal of a precursor to "Church thesis" that he called "Thesis I", and a few years later Kleene's renaming his Thesis "Church's Thesis" and proposing "Turing's Thesis".</p>
<h3>Emil Post (1936) and Alan Turing (1936–37, 1939)</h3>
<p>Here is a remarkable coincidence of two men not knowing each other but describing a process of men-as-computers working on computations—and they yield virtually identical definitions.</p>
<p>Emil Post (1936) described the actions of a "computer" (human being) as follows:</p>
<p>His symbol space would be</p>
<p>Alan Turing's work preceded that of Stibitz (1937); it is unknown whether Stibitz knew of the work of Turing. Turing's biographer believed that Turing's use of a typewriter-like model derived from a youthful interest: "Alan had dreamt of inventing typewriters as a boy; Mrs. Turing had a typewriter; and he could well have begun by asking himself what was meant by calling a typewriter 'mechanical'". Given the prevalence of Morse code and telegraphy, ticker tape machines, and teletypewriters we might conjecture that all were influences.</p>
<p>Turing—his model of computation is now called a Turing machine—begins, as did Post, with an analysis of a human computer that he whittles down to a simple set of basic motions and "states of mind". But he continues a step further and creates a machine as a model of computation of numbers.</p>
<p>Turing's reduction yields the following:</p>
<p>"It may be that some of these change necessarily invoke a change of state of mind. The most general single operation must therefore be taken to be one of the following:</p>
<p>A few years later, Turing expanded his analysis (thesis, definition) with this forceful expression of it:</p>
<h3>J. B. Rosser (1939) and S. C. Kleene (1943)</h3>
<p><i>J. Barkley Rosser</i> defined an 'effective [mathematical] method' in the following manner (italicization added):</p>
<p>Rosser's footnote #5 references the work of (1) Church and Kleene and their definition of λ-definability, in particular Church's use of it in his <i>An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory</i> (1936); (2) Herbrand and Gödel and their use of recursion in particular Gödel's use in his famous paper <i>On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I</i> (1931); and (3) Post (1936) and Turing (1936–7) in their mechanism-models of computation.</p>
<p><i>Stephen C. Kleene</i> defined as his now-famous "Thesis I" known as the Church–Turing thesis. But he did this in the following context (boldface in original):</p>
<h3>History after 1950</h3>
<p>A number of efforts have been directed toward further refinement of the definition of "algorithm", and activity is on-going because of issues surrounding, in particular, foundations of mathematics (especially the Church–Turing thesis) and philosophy of mind (especially arguments around artificial intelligence). For more, see Algorithm characterizations.</p>
