<h1>Subgraph isomorphism problem</h1>
<p>In theoretical computer science, the <b>subgraph isomorphism</b> problem is a computational task in which two graphs <i>G</i> and <i>H</i> are given as input, and one must determine whether <i>G</i> contains a subgraph that is isomorphic to <i>H</i>. Subgraph isomorphism is a generalization of both the maximum clique problem and the problem of testing whether a graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle, and is therefore NP-complete. However certain other cases of subgraph isomorphism may be solved in polynomial time.</p>
<p>Sometimes the name <b>subgraph matching</b> is also used for the same problem. This name puts emphasis on finding such a subgraph as opposed to the bare decision problem.</p>

<h2>Decision problem and computational complexity</h2>
<p>To prove subgraph isomorphism is NP-complete, it must be formulated as a decision problem. The input to the decision problem is a pair of graphs <i>G</i> and <i>H</i>. The answer to the problem is positive if <i>H</i> is isomorphic to a subgraph of <i>G</i>, and negative otherwise.</p>

<p>The proof of subgraph isomorphism being NP-complete is simple and based on reduction of the clique problem, an NP-complete decision problem in which the input is a single graph <i>G</i> and a number <i>k</i>, and the question is whether <i>G</i> contains a complete subgraph with <i>k</i> vertices. To translate this to a subgraph isomorphism problem, simply let <i>H</i> be the complete graph <i>K</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>; then the answer to the subgraph isomorphism problem for <i>G</i> and <i>H</i> is equal to the answer to the clique problem for <i>G</i> and <i>k</i>. Since the clique problem is NP-complete, this polynomial-time many-one reduction shows that subgraph isomorphism is also NP-complete.</p>
<p>An alternative reduction from the Hamiltonian cycle problem translates a graph <i>G</i> which is to be tested for Hamiltonicity into the pair of graphs <i>G</i> and <i>H</i>, where <i>H</i> is a cycle having the same number of vertices as <i>G</i>. Because the Hamiltonian cycle problem is NP-complete even for planar graphs, this shows that subgraph isomorphism remains NP-complete even in the planar case.</p>
<p>Subgraph isomorphism is a generalization of the graph isomorphism problem, which asks whether <i>G</i> is isomorphic to <i>H</i>: the answer to the graph isomorphism problem is true if and only if <i>G</i> and <i>H</i> both have the same numbers of vertices and edges and the subgraph isomorphism problem for <i>G</i> and <i>H</i> is true. However the complexity-theoretic status of graph isomorphism remains an open question.</p>
<p>In the context of the Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture on the query complexity of monotone graph properties, Gröger (1992) showed that any subgraph isomorphism problem has query complexity Ω(<i>n</i>); that is, solving the subgraph isomorphism requires an algorithm to check the presence or absence in the input of Ω(<i>n</i>) different edges in the graph.</p>
<h2>Algorithms</h2>
<p>Ullmann (1976) describes a recursive backtracking procedure for solving the subgraph isomorphism problem. Although its running time is, in general, exponential, it takes polynomial time for any fixed choice of <i>H</i> (with a polynomial that depends on the choice of <i>H</i>). When <i>G</i> is a planar graph and <i>H</i> is fixed, the running time of subgraph isomorphism can be reduced to linear time.</p>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<p>As subgraph isomorphism has been applied in the area of cheminformatics to find similarities between chemical compounds from their structural formula; often in this area the term <b>substructure search</b> is used. Typically a query structure is defined as SMARTS, a SMILES extension.</p>
<p>The closely related problem of counting the number of isomorphic copies of a graph <i>H</i> in a larger graph <i>G</i> has been applied to pattern discovery in databases, the bioinformatics of protein-protein interaction networks, and in exponential random graph methods for mathematically modeling social networks.</p>
<p>Ohlrich et al. (1993) describe an application of subgraph isomorphism in the computer-aided design of electronic circuits. Subgraph matching is also a substep in graph rewriting (the most runtime-intensive), and thus offered by graph rewrite tools.</p>
<p>The problem is also of interest in artificial intelligence, where it considered part of an array of pattern matching in graphs problems; an extension of subgraph isomorphism known as graph mining is also of interest in that area.</p>
