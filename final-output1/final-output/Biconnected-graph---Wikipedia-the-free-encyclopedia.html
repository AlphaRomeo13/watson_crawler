<h1>Biconnected graph</h1>
<p>In graph theory, a <b>biconnected graph</b> is a connected and "nonseparable" graph, meaning that if any vertex were to be removed, the graph will remain connected. Therefore a biconnected graph has no articulation vertices.</p>
<p>The property of being 2-connected is equivalent to biconnectivity, with the caveat that the complete graph of two vertices is sometimes regarded as biconnected but not 2-connected.</p>
<p>This property is especially useful in maintaining a graph with a two-fold redundancy, to prevent disconnection upon the removal of a single edge (or connection).</p>
<p>The use of <b>biconnected</b> graphs is very important in the field of networking (see Network flow), because of this property of redundancy.</p>

<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>A <b>biconnected</b> undirected graph is a connected graph that is not broken into disconnected pieces by deleting any single vertex (and its incident edges).</p>
<p>A <b>biconnected</b> directed graph is one such that for any two vertices <i>v</i> and <i>w</i> there are two directed paths from <i>v</i> to <i>w</i> which have no vertices in common other than <i>v</i> and <i>w</i>.</p>
