<h1>Global optimum</h1>
<p>In mathematics, a <b>global optimum</b> is a selection from a given domain which provides either the highest value (the global maximum) or lowest value (the global minimum), depending on the objective, when a specific function is applied. For example, for the function</p>
<p>defined on the real numbers, the global maximum occurs at <i>x</i> = 0, where <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) = 2. For all other values of <i>x</i>, <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) is smaller.</p>
<p>For purposes of optimization, a function must be defined over the whole domain, and must have a range which is a totally ordered set, in order that the evaluations of distinct domain elements are comparable.</p>
<p>By contrast, a local optimum is a selection for which <i>neighboring</i> selections yield values that are not greater (for a local maximum) or not smaller (for a local minimum). The concept of a local optimum implies that the domain is a metric space or topological space, in order that the notion of "neighborhood" should be meaningful.</p>
<p>If the function to be maximized is quasi-concave, or if the function to be minimized is quasi-convex, then a local optimum is also the global optimum.</p>
