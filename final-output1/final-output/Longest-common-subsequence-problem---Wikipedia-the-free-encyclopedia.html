<h1>Longest common subsequence problem</h1>
<p>The <b>longest common subsequence</b> (<b>LCS</b>) <b>problem</b> is the problem of finding the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two sequences). It differs from problems of finding common substrings: unlike substrings, subsequences are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences. The longest common subsequence problem is a classic computer science problem, the basis of data comparison programs such as the <tt>diff</tt> utility, and has applications in bioinformatics. It is also widely used by revision control systems such as Git for reconciling multiple changes made to a revision-controlled collection of files.</p>

<h2>Complexity</h2>
<p>For the general case of an arbitrary number of input sequences, the problem is NP-hard. When the number of sequences is constant, the problem is solvable in polynomial time by dynamic programming (see <i>Solution</i> below). Assume you have <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="N" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/d/9/8d9c307cb7f3c4a32822a51922d1ceaa.png"> sequences of lengths <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="n_1, ..., n_N" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/4/1/041eccd2bd2ee41d16d74cfc8cfd79f4.png">. A naive search would test each of the <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="2^{n_1}" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/2/9/9290d1735ecbbf9dc6d966a795564465.png"> subsequences of the first sequence to determine whether they are also subsequences of the remaining sequences; each subsequence may be tested in time linear in the lengths of the remaining sequences, so the time for this algorithm would be</p>
<p>For the case of two sequences of <i>n</i> and <i>m</i> elements, the running time of the dynamic programming approach is O(<i>n</i> × <i>m</i>). For an arbitrary number of input sequences, the dynamic programming approach gives a solution in</p>
<p>There exist methods with lower complexity, which often depend on the length of the LCS, the size of the alphabet, or both.</p>
<p>Notice that the LCS is not necessarily unique; for example the LCS of "ABC" and "ACB" is both "AB" and "AC". Indeed the LCS problem is often defined to be finding <i>all</i> common subsequences of a maximum length. This problem inherently has higher complexity, as the number of such subsequences is exponential in the worst case, even for only two input strings.</p>
<h2>Solution for two sequences</h2>
<p>The LCS problem has an optimal substructure: the problem can be broken down into smaller, simple "subproblems", which can be broken down into yet simpler subproblems, and so on, until, finally, the solution becomes trivial. The LCS problem also has overlapping subproblems: the solution to a higher subproblem depends on the solutions to several of the lower subproblems. Problems with these two properties—optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems—can be approached by a problem-solving technique called dynamic programming, in which the solution is built up starting with the simplest subproblems. The procedure requires memoization—saving the solutions to one level of subproblem in a table (analogous to writing them to a <i>memo</i>, hence the name) so that the solutions are available to the next level of subproblems. This method is illustrated here.</p>
<h3>Prefixes</h3>
<p>The subproblems become simpler as the sequences become shorter. Shorter sequences are conveniently described using the term <i>prefix</i>. A prefix of a sequence is the sequence with the end cut off. Let <i>S</i> be the sequence (AGCA). Then, the sequence (AG) is one of the prefixes of <i>S</i>. Prefixes are denoted with the name of the sequence, followed by a subscript to indicate how many characters the prefix contains. The prefix (AG) is denoted <i>S</i><sub>2</sub>, since it contains the first 2 elements of <i>S</i>. The possible prefixes of <i>S</i> are</p>
<p>The solution to the LCS problem for two arbitrary sequences, <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>, amounts to construct some function, <i>LCS</i>(<i>X</i>, <i>Y</i>), that gives the longest subsequences common to <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>. That function relies on the following two properties.</p>
<h3>First property</h3>
<p>Suppose that two sequences both end in the same element. To find their LCS, shorten each sequence by removing the last element, find the LCS of the shortened sequences, and to that LCS append the removed element.</p>
<p>In terms of prefixes,</p>
<p>where the comma indicates that the following element, <i>x<sub>n</sub></i>, is appended to the sequence. Note that the LCS for <i>X<sub>n</sub></i> and <i>Y<sub>m</sub></i> involves determining the LCS of the shorter sequences, <i>X<sub>n</sub></i><sub>-1</sub> and <i>Y<sub>m</sub></i><sub>-1</sub>.</p>
<h3>Second property</h3>
<p>Suppose that the two sequences X and Y do not end in the same symbol. Then the LCS of X and Y is the longer of the two sequences LCS(X<sub>n</sub>,Y<sub>m-1</sub>) and LCS(X<sub>n-1</sub>,Y<sub>m</sub>).</p>
<p>To understand this property, consider the two following sequences :</p>
<p>sequence X: ABCDEFG (n elements)<br>
sequence Y: BCDGK (m elements)</p>
<p>The LCS of these two sequences either ends with a G (the last element of sequence X) or does not.</p>
<p><b>Case 1: the LCS ends with a G</b><br>
Then it cannot end with a K. Thus it does not hurt to remove the K from sequence Y: if K were in the LCS, it would be its last character; as a consequence K is not in the LCS. We can then write: LCS(X<sub>n</sub>,Y<sub>m</sub>) = LCS(X<sub>n</sub>, Y<sub>m-1</sub>).</p>
<p><b>Case 2: the LCS does not end with a G</b><br>
Then it does not hurt to remove the G from the sequence X (for the same reason as above). And then we can write: LCS(X<sub>n</sub>,Y<sub>m</sub>) = LCS(X<sub>n-1</sub>, Y<sub>m</sub>).</p>
<p>In any case, the LCS we are looking for is one of LCS(X<sub>n</sub>, Y<sub>m-1</sub>) or LCS(X<sub>n-1</sub>, Y<sub>m</sub>). Those two last LCS are both common subsequences to X and Y. LCS(X,Y) is the longest. Thus its value is the longest sequence of LCS(X<sub>n</sub>, Y<sub>m-1</sub>) and LCS(X<sub>n-1</sub>, Y<sub>m</sub>).</p>
<h3><i>LCS</i> function defined</h3>
<p>Let two sequences be defined as follows: <i>X</i> = (<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>x</i><sub>2</sub>...<i>x</i><sub>m</sub>) and <i>Y</i> = (<i>y</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>2</sub>...<i>y</i><sub>n</sub>). The prefixes of <i>X</i> are <i>X</i><sub>1, 2,...m</sub>; the prefixes of <i>Y</i> are <i>Y</i><sub>1, 2,...n</sub>. Let <i>LCS</i>(<i>X</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>, <i>Y</i><sub><i>j</i></sub>) represent the set of longest common subsequence of prefixes <i>X<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>Y<sub>j</sub></i>. This set of sequences is given by the following.</p>
<p>To find the longest subsequences common to <i>X<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>Y<sub>j</sub></i>, compare the elements <i>x<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>y<sub>j</sub></i>. If they are equal, then the sequence <i>LCS</i>(<i>X</i><sub><i>i</i>-1</sub>, <i>Y</i><sub><i>j</i>-1</sub>) is extended by that element, <i>x<sub>i</sub></i>. If they are not equal, then the longer of the two sequences, <i>LCS</i>(<i>X</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>, <i>Y</i><sub><i>j</i>-1</sub>), and <i>LCS</i>(<i>X</i><sub><i>i</i>-1</sub>, <i>Y</i><sub><i>j</i></sub>), is retained. (If they are both the same length, but not identical, then both are retained.) Notice that the subscripts are reduced by 1 in these formulas. That can result in a subscript of 0. Since the sequence elements are defined to start at 1, it was necessary to add the requirement that the LCS is empty when a subscript is zero.</p>
<h3>Worked example</h3>
<p>The longest subsequence common to <i>C</i> = (AGCAT), and <i>R</i> = (GAC) will be found. Because the <i>LCS</i> function uses a "zeroth" element, it is convenient to define zero prefixes that are empty for these sequences: <i>C</i><sub>0</sub> = Ø; and <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> = Ø. All the prefixes are placed in a table with <i>C</i> in the first row (making it a <u>c</u>olumn header) and <i>R</i> in the first column (making it a <u>r</u>ow header).</p>
<p>This table is used to store the LCS sequence for each step of the calculation. The second column and second row have been filled in with Ø, because when an empty sequence is compared with a non-empty sequence, the longest common subsequence is always an empty sequence.</p>
<p><i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>1</sub>) is determined by comparing the first elements in each sequence. G and A are not the same, so this LCS gets (using the "second property") the longest of the two sequences, <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>0</sub>) and <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>1</sub>). According to the table, both of these are empty, so <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>1</sub>) is also empty, as shown in the table below. The arrows indicate that the sequence comes from both the cell above, <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>1</sub>) and the cell on the left, <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>0</sub>).</p>
<p><i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>2</sub>) is determined by comparing G and G. They match, so G is appended to the upper left sequence, <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>1</sub>), which is (Ø), giving (ØG), which is (G).</p>
<p>For <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>3</sub>), G and C do not match. The sequence above is empty; the one to the left contains one element, G. Selecting the longest of these, <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>3</sub>) is (G). The arrow points to the left, since that is the longest of the two sequences.</p>
<p><i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>4</sub>), likewise, is (G).</p>
<p><i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>5</sub>), likewise, is (G).</p>
<p>For <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>1</sub>), A is compared with A. The two elements match, so A is appended to Ø, giving (A).</p>
<p>For <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>2</sub>), A and G do not match, so the longest of <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>2</sub>), which is (G), and <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>1</sub>), which is (A), is used. In this case, they each contain one element, so this LCS is given two subsequences: (A) and (G).</p>
<p>For <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>3</sub>), A does not match C. <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>2</sub>) contains sequences (A) and (G); LCS(<i>R</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>3</sub>) is (G), which is already contained in <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>2</sub>). The result is that <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>3</sub>) also contains the two subsequences, (A) and (G).</p>
<p>For <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>4</sub>), A matches A, which is appended to the upper left cell, giving (GA).</p>
<p>For <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>5</sub>), A does not match T. Comparing the two sequences, (GA) and (G), the longest is (GA), so <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>5</sub>) is (GA).</p>
<p>For <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>3</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>1</sub>), C and A do not match, so <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>3</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>1</sub>) gets the longest of the two sequences, (A).</p>
<p>For <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>3</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>2</sub>), C and G do not match. Both <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>3</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>1</sub>) and <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>2</sub>) have one element. The result is that <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>3</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>2</sub>) contains the two subsequences, (A) and (G).</p>
<p>For <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>3</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>3</sub>), C and C match, so C is appended to <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>2</sub>), which contains the two subsequences, (A) and (G), giving (AC) and (GC).</p>
<p>For <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>3</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>4</sub>), C and A do not match. Combining <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>3</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>3</sub>), which contains (AC) and (GC), and <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>4</sub>), which contains (GA), gives a total of three sequences: (AC), (GC), and (GA).</p>
<p>Finally, for <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>3</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>5</sub>), C and T do not match. The result is that <i>LCS</i>(<i>R</i><sub>3</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>5</sub>) also contains the three sequences, (AC), (GC), and (GA).</p>
<p>The final result is that the last cell contains all the longest subsequences common to (AGCAT) and (GAC); these are (AC), (GC), and (GA). The table also shows the longest common subsequences for every possible pair of prefixes. For example, for (AGC) and (GA), the longest common subsequence are (A) and (G).</p>
<h3>Traceback approach</h3>
<p>Calculating the LCS of a row of the LCS table requires only the solutions to the current row and the previous row. Still, for long sequences, these sequences can get numerous and long, requiring a lot of storage space. Storage space can be saved by saving not the actual subsequences, but the length of the subsequence and the direction of the arrows, as in the table below.</p>
<p>The actual subsequences are deduced in a "traceback" procedure that follows the arrows backwards, starting from the last cell in the table. When the length decreases, the sequences must have had a common element. Several paths are possible when two arrows are shown in a cell. Below is the table for such an analysis, with numbers colored in cells where the length is about to decrease. The bold numbers trace out the sequence, (GA).</p>

<h2>Code optimization</h2>
<p>Several optimizations can be made to the algorithm above to speed it up for real-world cases.</p>
<h3>Reduce the problem set</h3>
<p>The C matrix in the naive algorithm grows quadratically with the lengths of the sequences. For two 100-item sequences, a 10,000-item matrix would be needed, and 10,000 comparisons would need to be done. In most real-world cases, especially source code diffs and patches, the beginnings and ends of files rarely change, and almost certainly not both at the same time. If only a few items have changed in the middle of the sequence, the beginning and end can be eliminated. This reduces not only the memory requirements for the matrix, but also the number of comparisons that must be done.</p>

</pre>
<p>In the best-case scenario, a sequence with no changes, this optimization would completely eliminate the need for the C matrix. In the worst-case scenario, a change to the very first and last items in the sequence, only two additional comparisons are performed.</p>
<h3>Reduce the comparison time</h3>
<p>Most of the time taken by the naive algorithm is spent performing comparisons between items in the sequences. For textual sequences such as source code, you want to view lines as the sequence elements instead of single characters. This can mean comparisons of relatively long strings for each step in the algorithm. Two optimizations can be made that can help to reduce the time these comparisons consume.</p>
<h3>Reduce strings to hashes</h3>
<p>A hash function or checksum can be used to reduce the size of the strings in the sequences. That is, for source code where the average line is 60 or more characters long, the hash or checksum for that line might be only 8 to 40 characters long. Additionally, the randomized nature of hashes and checksums would guarantee that comparisons would short-circuit faster, as lines of source code will rarely be changed at the beginning.</p>
<p>There are three primary drawbacks to this optimization. First, an amount of time needs to be spent beforehand to precompute the hashes for the two sequences. Second, additional memory needs to be allocated for the new hashed sequences. However, in comparison to the naive algorithm used here, both of these drawbacks are relatively minimal.</p>
<p>The third drawback is that of collisions. Since the checksum or hash is not guaranteed to be unique, there is a small chance that two different items could be reduced to the same hash. This is unlikely in source code, but it is possible. A cryptographic hash would therefore be far better suited for this optimization, as its entropy is going to be significantly greater than that of a simple checksum. However, the benefits may not be worth the setup and computational requirements of a cryptographic hash for small sequence lengths.</p>
<h3>Reduce the required space</h3>
<p>If only the length of the LCS is required, the matrix can be reduced to a <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="2\times \min(n,m)" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/e/4/5e45d3dd189425baabf340e1c3e7a62e.png"> matrix with ease, or to a <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="\min(m,n)+1" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/9/1/f914f35b893c8392f45197525107d521.png"> vector (smarter) as the dynamic programming approach only needs the current and previous columns of the matrix. Hirschberg's algorithm allows the construction of the optimal sequence itself in the same quadratic time and linear space bounds.</p>
<h3>Further optimized algorithms</h3>
<p>Several algorithms exist that are worst-case faster than the presented dynamic programming approach. For problems with a bounded alphabet size, the Method of Four Russians can be used to reduce the running time of the dynamic programming algorithm by a logarithmic factor.  For <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="r" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/b/4/4b43b0aee35624cd95b910189b3dc231.png"> (and <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="n &gt; m" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/b/f/fbfdd0f9e1e5bad1c234b8cef524b14c.png">), the number of matches between the two sequences, there is an algorithm that performs in <img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline tex" alt="O((n + r)\log(n))" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/3/5/d35b61b199e462ce7ff0e18d10d978ab.png"> time.</p>
<h2>Behavior on random strings</h2>
<p>Beginning with Chvátal &amp; Sankoff (1975), a number of researchers have investigated the behavior of the longest common subsequence length when the two given strings are drawn randomly from the same alphabet. When the alphabet size is constant, the expected length of the LCS is proportional to the length of the two strings, and the constants of proportionality (depending on alphabet size) are known as the Chvátal–Sankoff constants. Their exact values are not known, but upper and lower bounds on their values have been proven, and it is known that they grow inversely proportionally to the square root of the alphabet size. Simplified mathematical models of the longest common subsequence problem have been shown to be controlled by the Tracy–Widom distribution.</p>
