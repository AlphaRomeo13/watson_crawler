<h1>New York State Identification and Intelligence System</h1>
<p>The <b>New York State Identification and Intelligence System</b> Phonetic Code, commonly known as NYSIIS, is a phonetic algorithm devised in 1970 as part of the New York State Identification and Intelligence System (now a part of the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services). It features an accuracy increase of 2.7% over the traditional Soundex algorithm.</p>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>The algorithm, as described in <i>Name Search Techniques</i>, is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Translate first characters of name: MAC → MCC, KN → N, K → C, PH, PF → FF, SCH → SSS</li>
<li>Translate last characters of name: EE → Y, IE → Y, DT, RT, RD, NT, ND → D</li>
<li>First character of key = first character of name.</li>
<li>Translate remaining characters by following rules, incrementing by one character each time:
<ol>
<li>EV → AF else A, E, I, O, U → A</li>
<li>Q → G, Z → S, M → N</li>
<li>KN → N else K → C</li>
<li>SCH → SSS, PH → FF</li>
<li>H → If previous or next is non-vowel, previous.</li>
<li>W → If previous is vowel, A.</li>
<li>Add current to key if current is not same as the last key character.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If last character is S, remove it.</li>
<li>If last characters are AY, replace with Y.</li>
<li>If last character is A, remove it.</li>
<li>Append translated key to value from step 3 (removed first character)</li>
<li>If longer than 6 characters, truncate to first 6 characters. (only needed for true NYSIIS, some versions use the full key)</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>EV → AF else A, E, I, O, U → A</li>
<li>Q → G, Z → S, M → N</li>
<li>KN → N else K → C</li>
<li>SCH → SSS, PH → FF</li>
<li>H → If previous or next is non-vowel, previous.</li>
<li>W → If previous is vowel, A.</li>
<li>Add current to key if current is not same as the last key character.</li>
</ol>
