<h1>Worker Threads and SwingWorker</h1>
<p>When a Swing program needs to execute a long-running task, it usually uses one of the <i>worker threads</i>, also known as the <i>background threads</i>. Each task running on a worker thread is represented by an instance of 
<a class="APILink" target="_blank" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/SwingWorker.html"><code>javax.swing.SwingWorker</code></a>. <code>SwingWorker</code> itself is an abstract class; you must define a subclass in order to create a <code>SwingWorker</code> object; anonymous inner classes are often useful for creating very simple <code>SwingWorker</code> objects.</p>
<p><code>SwingWorker</code> provides a number of communication and control features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>SwingWorker</code> subclass can define a method, <code>done</code>, which is automatically invoked on the event dispatch thread when the background task is finished.</li>
<li><code>SwingWorker</code> implements 
<a class="APILink" target="_blank" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Future.html"><code>java.util.concurrent.Future</code></a>. This interface allows the background task to provide a return value to the other thread. Other methods in this interface allow cancellation of the background task and discovering whether the background task has finished or been cancelled.</li>
<li>The background task can provide intermediate results by invoking <code>SwingWorker.publish</code>, causing <code>SwingWorker.process</code> to be invoked from the event dispatch thread.</li>
<li>The background task can define bound properties. Changes to these properties trigger events, causing event-handling methods to be invoked on the event dispatch thread.</li>
</ul>
<p>These features are discussed in the following subsections.</p>
<p>The <code>javax.swing.SwingWorker</code> class was added to the Java platform in Java SE 6. Prior to this, another class, also called <code>SwingWorker</code>, was widely used for some of the same purposes. The old <code>SwingWorker</code> was not part of the Java platform specification, and was not provided as part of the JDK.</p>
<p>The new <code>javax.swing.SwingWorker</code> is a completely new class. Its functionality is not a strict superset of the old <code>SwingWorker</code>. Methods in the two classes that have the same function do not have the same names. Also, instances of the old <code>SwingWorker</code> class were reusable, while a new instance of <code>javax.swing.SwingWorker</code> is needed for each new background task.</p>
<p>Throughout the Java Tutorials, any mention of <code>SwingWorker</code> now refers to <code>javax.swing.SwingWorker</code>.</p>
