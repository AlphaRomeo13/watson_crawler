<h1>Demo - ChooseDropAction</h1>
<p>The following demo, <code>ChooseDropActionDemo</code>, contains three lists. As you can see in the screen shot, the list on the left, labeled "Drag from here", is the drag source. This list supports both move and copy but it does not implement import — so you cannot drop into it.</p>
<p>On the right side are two lists that act as drop targets. The top list, labeled "Drop to COPY here" will only allow data to be copied to it. The bottom list, labeled "Drop to MOVE here" will only allow data to be moved to it. The source list only allows data to be dragged from it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the Launch button to run <code>ChooseDropActionDemo</code> using 
<a class="OutsideLink" target="_blank" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/javawebstart/index.html">Java™ Web Start</a> (<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">download JDK 7 or later</a>). Alternatively, to compile and run the example yourself, consult the <a href="../examples/dnd/index.html#ChooseDropAction">example index</a>.<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorialJWS/samples/uiswing/ChooseDropActionDemoProject/ChooseDropActionDemo.jnlp"><img src="../../images/jws-launch-button.png" width="88" height="23" align="bottom" alt="Launches the ChooseDropActionDemo example"></a><br></li>
<li>Select an item in the source list and drag to the upper target list. As you drag over the target, notice that the copy-drop mouse cursor displays, even if you are not holding the Control key to signify that you want a copy action. (Note that the copy cursor does not appear on the Macintosh platform, unless you are pressing the Option key.)</li>
<li>Drop the item. It is inserted into the target list but not removed from the source — as desired.</li>
<li>Drag again from the source list, but this time into the lower target list. Drop the item. It is inserted into the target list and removed from the source list.</li>
<li>Select another item in the source list and, while pressing the Control key to indicate a preference for the COPY action, drag the item to the lower target list.</li>
<li>Drop the item into the list. The item is not inserted — the drop is rejected. The <code>canImport</code> method for the transfer handler was coded to reject the COPY action, but it could have been implemented to return true, in which case the user action would prevail and a copy would occur.</li>

<p>The <code>FromTransferHandler</code>, attached to the source list, allows for dragging from the list and supports both copy and move actions. If you try to drop onto this list, the drop will be rejected because <code>FromTransferHandler</code> has not implemented the <code>canImport</code> and <code>importData</code> methods.</p>
<p>The <code>ToTransferHandler</code>, attached to <em>both</em> the move-only and the copy-only target list, contains a constructor that specifies whether the target list will allow only copy or only move. An instance that supports the copy action is attached to the copy-only list and an instance that supports the move action is attached to the move-only list.</p>
<p>You might also be interested in the 
<a class="TutorialLink" target="_top" href="toplevel.html">Top-Level Drop</a> example which also illustrates choosing the drop action.</p>
<p>Next we look at showing the drop location.</p>
