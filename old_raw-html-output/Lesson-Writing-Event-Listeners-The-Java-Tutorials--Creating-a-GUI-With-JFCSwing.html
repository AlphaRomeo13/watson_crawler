<h1>Lesson: Writing Event Listeners</h1>
<p>This lesson gives you details about writing event listeners. You might not need to read this section. Your first source of information for event should be the how-to section for the component in question.
<!--
You can find the appropriate section using the

Each component's section shows code for handling the events most commonly needed when implementing the component. For example, 
<a class="TutorialLink" target="_top" href="../components/button.html#checkbox">How to Use Check Boxes</a> shows you how to handle mouse clicks on check boxes using an item listener.</p>
