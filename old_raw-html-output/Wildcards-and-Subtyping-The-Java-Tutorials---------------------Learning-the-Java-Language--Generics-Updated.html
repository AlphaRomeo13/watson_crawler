<h1>Wildcards and Subtyping</h1>
<p>
As described in
<a class="TutorialLink" target="_top" href="inheritance.html">Generics, Inheritance, and Subtypes</a>, generic classes or interfaces are not related merely because there is a relationship between their types. However, you can use wildcards to create a relationship between generic classes or interfaces.</p>
<p>
Given the following two regular (non-generic) classes:</p>
<p>WHATSON? f4f9a7cc-fec3-4744-a65f-8c50ea7ac116</p>
<pre>
class A { /* ... */ }
class B extends A { /* ... */ }
</pre>
<p>
It would be reasonable to write the following code:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 17dc0683-2cbb-493c-84fd-9fd3c0a30c37</p>
<pre>
B b = new B();
A a = b;
</pre>
<p>
This example shows that inheritance of regular classes follows this rule of subtyping: class <tt>B</tt> is a subtype of class <tt>A</tt> if <tt>B</tt> extends <tt>A</tt>. This rule does not apply to generic types:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 34b3de54-e2c0-4de9-ba92-fcf00e5b5829</p>
<pre>
List&lt;B&gt; lb = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
List&lt;A&gt; la = lb;   // compile-time error
</pre>
<p>
Given that <tt>Integer</tt> is a subtype of <tt>Number</tt>, what is the relationship between <tt>List&lt;Integer&gt;</tt> and <tt>List&lt;Number&gt;</tt>?</p>
<p>
Although <tt>Integer</tt> is a subtype of <tt>Number</tt>, <tt>List&lt;Integer&gt;</tt> is not a subtype of <tt>List&lt;Number&gt;</tt> and, in fact, these two types are not related. The common parent of <tt>List&lt;Number&gt;</tt> and <tt>List&lt;Integer&gt;</tt> is <tt>List&lt;?&gt;</tt>.</p>
<p>
In order to create a relationship between these classes so that the code can access <tt>Number</tt>'s methods through <tt>List&lt;Integer&gt;</tt>'s elements, use an upper bounded wildcard:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 4822b6be-e43e-404d-a940-a2d34d062955</p>
<pre>
List&lt;? extends Integer&gt; intList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
List&lt;? extends Number&gt;  numList = intList;  // OK. List&lt;? extends Integer&gt; is a subtype of List&lt;? extends Number&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Because <tt>Integer</tt> is a subtype of <tt>Number</tt>, and <tt>numList</tt> is a list of <tt>Number</tt> objects, a relationship now exists between <tt>intList</tt> (a list of <tt>Integer</tt> objects) and <tt>numList</tt>. The following diagram shows the relationships between several <tt>List</tt> classes declared with both upper and lower bounded wildcards.</p>
<p>
The
<a class="TutorialLink" target="_top" href="wildcardGuidelines.html">Guidelines for Wildcard Use</a> section has more information about the ramifications of using upper and lower bounded wildcards.</p>
