<p>
All services must be represented by <code>&lt;service&gt;</code> elements in 
the manifest file.  Any that are not declared there will not be seen 
by the system and will never be run.
</p>
<p>
The <code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code> element has its own 
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#enabled">enabled</a></code> attribute that applies to all 
application components, including services.  The 
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code> and <code>&lt;service&gt;</code> 
attributes must both be "<code>true</code>" (as they both
are by default) for the service to be enabled.  If either is 
"<code>false</code>", the service is disabled; it cannot be instantiated.
</p>
<p>
The default value depends on whether the service contains intent filters.  The 
absence of any filters means that it can be invoked only by specifying 
its exact class name.  This implies that the service is intended only for 
application-internal use (since others would not know the class name).  So in 
this case, the default value is "<code>false</code>".
On the other hand, the presence of at least one filter implies that the service 
is intended for external use, so the default value is "<code>true</code>".
</p>
<p>
This attribute is not the only way to limit the exposure of a service to other
applications.  You can also use a permission to limit the external entities that 
can interact with the service (see the <code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/service-element.html#prmsn">permission</a></code> 
attribute).
</p>
<p>
The service's icon — whether set here or by the 
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code> element — is also the 
default icon for all the service's intent filters (see the 
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/intent-filter-element.html">&lt;intent-filter&gt;</a></code> element's 
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/intent-filter-element.html#icon">icon</a></code> attribute).
</p>
<p>
The service's label — whether set here or by the 
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code> element — is also the 
default label for all the service's intent filters (see the 
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/intent-filter-element.html">&lt;intent-filter&gt;</a></code> element's 
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/intent-filter-element.html#label">label</a></code> attribute). 
</p>
<p>
The label should be set as a reference to a string resource, so that
it can be localized like other strings in the user interface.  
However, as a convenience while you're developing the application, 
it can also be set as a raw string.
</p>
<p>Once you publish your application, you <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/06/things-that-cannot-change.html">should not
change this name</a> (unless you've set <code><a href="#exported">android:exported</a>="false"</code>).</p>
<p>
There is no default.  The name must be specified.
</p>
<p>
If this attribute is not set, the permission set by the 
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code> element's
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#prmsn">permission</a></code> 
attribute applies to the service.  If neither attribute is set, the service is
not protected by a permission.
</p>
<p>
For more information on permissions, see the 
<a href="/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html#sectperm">Permissions</a> 
section in the introduction and a separate document, 
<a href="/guide/topics/security/security.html">Security and Permissions</a>.
</p>
<p>
If the name assigned to this attribute begins with a colon (':'), a new 
process, private to the application, is created when it's needed and 
the service runs in that process.
If the process name begins with a lowercase character, the service will run 
in a global process of that name, provided that it has permission to do so.
This allows components in different applications to share a process, reducing 
resource usage.
