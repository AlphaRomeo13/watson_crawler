<h1>Lock Objects</h1>
<p>Synchronized code relies on a simple kind of reentrant lock. This kind of lock is easy to use, but has many limitations. More sophisticated locking idioms are supported by the 
<a class="APILink" target="_blank" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/package-summary.html"><code>java.util.concurrent.locks</code></a> package. We won't examine this package in detail, but instead will focus on its most basic interface, 
<a class="APILink" target="_blank" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/Lock.html"><code>Lock</code></a>.</p>
<p><code>Lock</code> objects work very much like the implicit locks used by synchronized code. As with implicit locks, only one thread can own a <code>Lock</code> object at a time. <code>Lock</code> objects also support a <code>wait/notify</code> mechanism, through their associated 
<a class="APILink" target="_blank" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/Condition.html"><code>Condition</code></a> objects.</p>
<p>The biggest advantage of <code>Lock</code> objects over implicit locks is their ability to back out of an attempt to acquire a lock. The <code>tryLock</code> method backs out if the lock is not available immediately or before a timeout expires (if specified). The <code>lockInterruptibly</code> method backs out if another thread sends an interrupt before the lock is acquired.</p>
<p>Let's use <code>Lock</code> objects to solve the deadlock problem we saw in <a href="liveness.html">Liveness</a>. Alphonse and Gaston have trained themselves to notice when a friend is about to bow. We model this improvement by requiring that our <code>Friend</code> objects must acquire locks for <i>both</i> participants before proceeding with the bow. Here is the source code for the improved model, 
<a class="SourceLink" target="_blank" href="examples/Safelock.java" onclick="showCode('../../displayCode.html', 'examples/Safelock.java'); return false;"><code><code>Safelock</code></code></a>. To demonstrate the versatility of this idiom, we assume that Alphonse and Gaston are so infatuated with their newfound ability to bow safely that they can't stop bowing to each other:</p>
