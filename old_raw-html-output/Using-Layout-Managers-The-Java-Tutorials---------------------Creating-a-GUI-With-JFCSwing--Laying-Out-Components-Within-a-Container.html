<h1>Using Layout Managers</h1>
<p>A layout manager is an object that implements the <code>LayoutManager</code> interface<a href="#footnote">*</a> and determines the size and position of the components within a container. Although components can provide size and alignment hints, a container's layout manager has the final say on the size and position of the components within the container.</p>

<h2><a name="set" id="set">Setting the Layout Manager</a></h2>
<p>As a rule, the only containers whose layout managers you need to worry about are 
<a class="TutorialLink" target="_top" href="../components/panel.html"><code>JPanel</code>s</a> and 
<a class="TutorialLink" target="_top" href="../components/toplevel.html#contentpane">content panes</a>. Each <code>JPanel</code> object is initialized to use a <code>FlowLayout</code>, unless you specify differently when creating the <code>JPanel</code>. Content panes use <code>BorderLayout</code> by default. If you do not like the default layout manager that a panel or content pane uses, you are free to change it to a different one. However, unless you are using <code>JToolBar</code>, the <code>FlowLayout</code> and <code>BorderLayout</code> managers are only useful for prototyping. Any real application will need to reset the layout manager. Again, you should use an appropriate tool to do this, rather than coding the manager by hand.</p>
<p>You can set a panel's layout manager using the <code>JPanel</code> constructor. For example:</p>
<p>WHATSON? cafad8a1-c595-46a5-a994-301f62642a54</p>
<pre>
JPanel panel = new JPanel(new BorderLayout());
</pre>
<p>After a container has been created, you can set its layout manager using the <code>setLayout</code> method. For example:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 3dfb3e5b-008f-46de-9c1d-98bb887a5073</p>
<pre>
Container contentPane = frame.getContentPane();
contentPane.setLayout(new FlowLayout());
</pre>
<p>Although we <i>strongly recommend</i> that you use layout managers, you can perform layout without them. By setting a container's layout property to null, you make the container use no layout manager. With this strategy, called <em>absolute positioning</em>, you must specify the size and position of every component within that container. One drawback of absolute positioning is that it does not adjust well when the top-level container is resized. It also does not adjust well to differences between users and systems, such as different font sizes and 
<a class="TutorialLink" target="_top" href="../../i18n/locale/index.html">locales</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="add" id="add">Adding Components to a Container</a></h2>
<p>When you add components to a panel or content pane, the arguments you specify to the <code>add</code> method depend on the layout manager that the panel or content pane is using. In fact, some layout managers do not even require you to add the component explicitly; for example, <code>GroupLayout</code>. For example, <code>BorderLayout</code> requires that you specify the area to which the component should be added (using one of the constants defined in <code>BorderLayout</code>) using code like this:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 9a311fd2-aa1a-430b-acc3-b174a9a9e0ad</p>
<pre>
pane.add(aComponent, BorderLayout.PAGE_START);
</pre>
<p>The how-to section for each layout manager has details on what, if any, arguments you need to specify to the <code>add</code> method. Some layout managers, such as <code>GridBagLayout</code> and <code>SpringLayout</code>, require elaborate setup procedures. Many layout managers, however, simply place components based on the order they were added to their container.</p>
<p>Swing containers other than <code>JPanel</code> and content panes generally provide API that you should use instead of the <code>add</code> method. For example, instead of adding a component directly to a 
<a class="TutorialLink" target="_top" href="../components/scrollpane.html">scroll pane</a> (or, actually, to its viewport), you either specify the component in the <code>JScrollPane</code> constructor or use <code>setViewportView</code>. Because of specialized API like this, you do not need to know which layout manager (if any) many Swing containers use. (For the curious: scroll panes happen to use a layout manager named <code>ScrollPaneLayout</code>.)</p>
<p>For information about how to add components to a specific container, see the how-to page for the container. You can find the component how-to pages using 
<a class="TutorialLink" target="_top" href="../components/componentlist.html">How to Use Various Components</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="sizealignment" id="sizealignment">Providing Size and Alignment Hints</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes you need to customize the size hints that a component provides to its container's layout manager, so that the component will be laid out well. You can do this by specifying one or more of the minimum, preferred, and maximum sizes of the component. You can invoke the component's methods for setting size hints  <code>setMinimumSize</code>, <code>setPreferredSize</code>, and <code>setMaximumSize</code>. Or you can create a subclass of the component that overrides the appropriate getter methods  <code>getMinimumSize</code>, <code>getPreferredSize</code>, and <code>getMaximumSize</code>. Here is an example of making a component's maximum size unlimited:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 06b60ab6-b1ab-40d4-83f3-9316f70bed8d</p>
<pre>
component.setMaximumSize(new Dimension(Integer.MAX_VALUE,
                                       Integer.MAX_VALUE));
</pre>
<p>Many layout managers do not pay attention to a component's requested maximum size. However, <code>BoxLayout</code> and <code>SpringLayout</code> do. Furthermore, <code>GroupLayout</code> provides the ability to set the minimum, preferred or maximum size explicitly, without touching the component.</p>
<p>Besides providing size hints, you can also provide alignment hints. For example, you can specify that the top edges of two components should be aligned. You set alignment hints either by invoking the component's <code>setAlignmentX</code> and <code>setAlignmentY</code> methods, or by overriding the component's <code>getAlignmentX</code> and <code>getAlignmentY</code> methods. Although most layout managers ignore alignment hints, <code>BoxLayout</code> honors them. You can find examples of setting the alignment in <a href="box.html">How to Use BoxLayout</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="space" id="space">Putting Space Between Components</a></h2>
<p>Three factors influence the amount of space between visible components in a container:</p>
<h2><a name="orientation" id="orientation">Setting the Container's Orientation</a></h2>
<p>This 
website
is written in English, with text that runs from left to right, and then top to bottom. However, many other languages have different orientations. The <code>componentOrientation</code> property provides a way of indicating that a particular component should use something different from the default left-to-right, top-to-bottom orientation. In a component such as a radio button, the orientation might be used as a hint that the look and feel should switch the locations of the icon and text in the button. In a container, the orientation is used as a hint to the layout manager.</p>
<p>To set a container's orientation, you can use either the <code>Component</code>-defined method 
<a class="APILink" target="_blank" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Component.html#setComponentOrientation-java.awt.ComponentOrientation-"><code>setComponentOrientation</code></a> or, to set the orientation on the container's children as well, 
<a class="APILink" target="_blank" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Component.html#applyComponentOrientation-java.awt.ComponentOrientation-"><code>applyComponentOrientation</code></a>. The argument to either method can be a constant such as <code>ComponentOrientation.RIGHT_TO_LEFT</code>, or it can be a call to the <code>ComponentOrientation</code> method 
<a class="APILink" target="_blank" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/ComponentOrientation.html#getOrientation-java.util.Locale-"><code>getOrientation(Locale)</code></a>. For example, the following code causes all <code>JComponent</code>s to be initialized with an Arabic-language locale, and then sets the orientation of the content pane and all components inside it accordingly:</p>
<p>WHATSON? eceffdd1-05ea-414f-a9a4-f922b5942c22</p>
<pre>
JComponent.setDefaultLocale(new Locale("ar"));
JFrame frame = new JFrame();
...
Container contentPane = frame.getContentPane();
contentPane.applyComponentOrientation(
    ComponentOrientation.getOrientation(
        contentPane.getLocale()));
</pre>
<p>Here are two pictures showing how <code>FlowLayout</code> lays out components in containers that are exactly the same, except for their orientation.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

Default orientation (left-to-right)</p>

<img src="../../figures/uiswing/layout/FlowLayoutDemo-rtl.png" width="471" height="70" alt="FlowLayoutDemo with right-to-left orientation"><br>
Right-to-left orientation</p>
<p>The standard layout managers that support component orientation are <code>FlowLayout</code>, <code>BorderLayout</code>, <code>BoxLayout</code>, <code>GridBagLayout</code>, and <code>GridLayout</code>.</p>
<h2><a name="choosing" id="choosing">Tips on Choosing a Layout Manager</a></h2>
<p>Layout managers have different strengths and weaknesses. This section discusses some common layout scenarios and which layout managers might work for each scenario. However, once again, it is strongly recommended that you use a builder tool to create your layout managers, such as the 
<a class="OutsideLink" target="_blank" href="http://netbeans.org/kb/trails/matisse.html">NetBeans IDE Matisse GUI builder</a>, rather than coding managers by hand. The scenarios listed below are given for information purposes, in case you are curious about which type of manager is used in different situations, or in case you absolutely must code your manager manually.</p>
<p>If none of the layout managers we discuss is right for your situation and you cannot use a builder tool, feel free to use other layout managers that you may write or find. Also keep in mind that flexible layout managers such as <code>GridBagLayout</code> and <code>SpringLayout</code> can fulfill many layout needs.</p>
<p>If you use <code>BorderLayout</code>, you will need to put the space-hungry component in the center. With <code>GridBagLayout</code>, you will need to set the constraints for the component so that <code>fill=GridBagConstraints.BOTH</code>. Another possibility is to use <a href="box.html"><code>BoxLayout</code></a>, making the space-hungry component specify very large preferred and maximum sizes.</p>
<h2><a name="thirdparty" id="thirdparty">Third Party Layout Managers</a></h2>
<p>Other third party layout managers have been created by the Swing community, to complement those provided by the Java platform. The following list is by no means definitive, but the layout managers listed below are the most popular:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a class="OutsideLink" target="_blank" href="http://www.miglayout.com/">MiGLayout</a></li>
<li>
<a class="OutsideLink" target="_blank" href="http://www.jgoodies.com/">Karsten Lentzsch's FormLayout</a></li>
</ul>
<p>*<a name="footnote" id="footnote">Way back in JDK 1.1</a> a second interface, <code>LayoutManager2</code>, was introduced. <code>LayoutManager2</code> extends <code>LayoutManager</code>, providing support for maximum size and alignment. <code>LayoutManager2</code> also adds the methods <code>addLayoutComponent</code>, that takes an <code>Object</code>, and <code>invalidateLayout</code>. Layout managers also need the notifications provided by <code>LayoutManager2</code>, so any modern layout manager will need to implement it.</p>
