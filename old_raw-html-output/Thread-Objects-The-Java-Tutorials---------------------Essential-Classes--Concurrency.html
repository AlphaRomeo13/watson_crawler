<h1>Thread Objects</h1>
<p>Each thread is associated with an instance of the class 
<a class="APILink" target="_blank" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html"><code>Thread</code></a>. There are two basic strategies for using <code>Thread</code> objects to create a concurrent application.</p>
<ul>
<li>To directly control thread creation and management, simply instantiate <code>Thread</code> each time the application needs to initiate an asynchronous task.</li>
<li>To abstract thread management from the rest of your application, pass the application's tasks to an <i>executor</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This section documents the use of <code>Thread</code> objects. Executors are discussed with other <a href="highlevel.html">high-level concurrency objects</a>.</p>
