<h1>Lesson: Modifying the Look and Feel</h1>
<p>This lesson tells you how to change the look and feel of your Swing application. The "look" of an application refers to its appearance.  The "feel" refers to how the widgets behave. You can choose to use the default Swing look and feel (e.g. the Ocean theme for the Metal look and feel), or the look and feel of the native platform (e.g. Windows, GTK+), or you can customize your own look and feel.</p>
