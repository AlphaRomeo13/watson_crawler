<p>The sentence in the intro describing the activity seems a bit weird ... "Each member performs the action the other is not currently doing: While one types in unit tests the other thinks about the class that will satisfy the test, for example." In my experience usually both programmers are working on <b>the one task</b> ... one is typing the code, and the other is helping to spot errors, for example. Maybe we should cite a source or two. <a href="/wiki/User:Stumps" title="User:Stumps">Stumps</a> 12:08, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is triple programming, quad programming, etc. also in common? --<a href="/wiki/User:Abdull" title="User:Abdull">Abdull</a> 17:06, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Three programmers in front of one computer" is certainly less common than "two programmers in front of one computer". According to <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TriProgramming" class="extiw" title="wikiwikiweb:TriProgramming">WikiWikiWeb:TriProgramming</a> and <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PairProgrammingPlusPlus" class="extiw" title="wikiwikiweb:PairProgrammingPlusPlus">WikiWikiWeb:PairProgrammingPlusPlus</a>, triple programming (subjectively) seems to have both advantages and disadvantages compared to pair programming. As far as I can tell, no one has ever objectively compared triple programming to pair programming or single programming. Triple programming might turn out to be the best -- or the worst -- of those alternatives. --<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:68.0.120.35&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:68.0.120.35 (page does not exist)">68.0.120.35</a> 22:09, 10 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>When working at Microsoft, I was handed a very hard to reproduce bug. I worked on it for 3 days, but although the problem did show up, the code seemed to be fine. I put several hundred breakpoints and watched almost every variable and still everything seemed to be right, the function was called only at the right times, but still the behavior of the whole program was incorrect.</p>
<p>The bug had something to do with UTF-8. At some place, ASCII was being used and the buffer would get garbage. The problem reduced to "who was using the wrong API?" in which the wrong AP woudl be strcpy and the right API would be utf8_strcpy, but the main problem was that strcpy was used literally millions of times in appropiate places, so finding the explicit line with problem was going to take too much time.</p>
<p>One morning I saw my boss with his boss and the test leader all looking at one screen in my boss's office. They all were debugging the code and looking for places where this could have happened, and then they realized the problem was in a little DLL we were using and which we didn't have the source code. It took a lot of time!!!</p>
<p>So, the 3-programming went on but they weren't programming, but were debugging at one screen. I think even though they weren't programming this is a valid example, because debugging at Microsoft usually takes too much time. The main reason is that they still don't discover <a href="/wiki/UnitTesting" title="UnitTesting" class="mw-redirect">UnitTesting</a></p>
<p>So much human power was needed because of the lack of abstraction. if all tyou do is to call strcpy, then you will have strcpy all over the place and eventually your program will be hard to change.</p>
<p>Cool story bro'. What the fuck does it have to do with anything?</p>

<p>WHATSON? c49cace4-d89d-470f-89ec-f3ecfe5b149f</p>

   * Experienced engineers quite likely produce code that is quite accurate, and the additional theoretical gain from pairing might not be worth the cost of an additional engineer. This is especially true when producing more trivial parts of the system.

<pre>
   * In the case where the team has slightly different work schedules, which is common in an environment that values work-life balance, the pair is only available during the overlap of their schedules. Therefore, not only does it require more man-hours to complete a task, a typical day has fewer pair-hours available, which further increases the overall task completion time.
   * Where a company values telecommuting (working from home) or when an employee must work from outside the office for whatever reasons, pair programming can be difficult and even impossible. However with broadband internet access and common screen sharing programs and VOIP technologies such as Skype, telecommuting can in fact better lend itself to pair programming. (see Remote pair programming)
   * Personality conflicts can result in one or both developers feeling awkward or uncomfortable.
   * Some developers can sit in front of a computer for many hours straight, others like to get up and walk around often.

<p>Did Laurie Williams write most of this article or sanction it? Most of the cites are quotes from her books and studies. And much of that is suspicious, such as "In our recent Web survey, we asked, 'What have you found beneficial about pair programming?' The single most common response was, 'It's a lot more fun!'" This is scientific? Sounds like it was probably a web survey of a pro-Pair Programming group.<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/76.168.64.243" title="Special:Contributions/76.168.64.243">76.168.64.243</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:76.168.64.243&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:76.168.64.243 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 19:33, 4 May 2008 (UTC)</p>
<p>All of the actual scientific, peer-reviewed studies I've read on pair programming have found no benefit to experienced programmers, only to students. This article is very heavily biased based on programmers self-reported _impressions_ and _feelings_ regarding the benefits, instead of the actual lines of code and quality of the code produced. Of course pair programming makes most programmers feel better about coding- coding is, like writing in general, a lonely, cognitively-rich task, and pairing makes it much less lonely- but that doesn't mean that it makes the output better. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/173.228.123.235" title="Special:Contributions/173.228.123.235">173.228.123.235</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:173.228.123.235&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:173.228.123.235 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 11:09, 6 November 2011 (UTC)</p>

<p>I can't back this up with a research link, but I'm sure you'll agree that this is a common problem with pairing, especially with verbose types who need to make their opinion heard. I've had whole pair programming sessions wasted with stupid conversations.

In particular, I'm hoping to see the "Costs and benefits" section summarize the findings regarding defect rates, time to completion, and total effort.

<p>Snipped the following section:</p>
<p>After reading it, I'm skeptical that it belongs in Wikipedia at all; it reads more like a new proposal than a description of something that exists. I haven't read the source, but I'm guessing it's a scholarly argument in favor of the technique rather than a description of something already in use.

<p>What is the purpose of the article? Content sounds too subjective. The most specific, technically accurate definition is "two people working together, at a single terminal".

<p><a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Yujunliang&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Yujunliang (page does not exist)">Yujunliang</a> has posted a pic in <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pair_programming&amp;oldid=424797249">this version</a> with the caption, "While hardware becoming relatively cheap these days, a new setup with two monitors sharing one workstation became more popular in the industry." Is this true? Are there sources that establish this? My understanding of pair programming is that: (a) the expense of hardware was never a concern, even in the earliest days: usually each programmer had a separate workstation, anyway, but when pairing, they worked at just one workstation; (b) pairing loses a lot of its effectiveness when both programmers are not looking at the same screen or when both programmers have access to keyboards (because the programmers stop reviewing each other's work and stop explaining out loud what they're doing). That's mostly from personal experience, although the sources I've seen nearly always speak of two programmers at one workstation, and the cost of programmer time has always been seen as the leading drawback of pairing, not the cost of the workstations. Has there been a big change? —<a href="/wiki/User:BenKovitz" title="User:BenKovitz">Ben Kovitz</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:BenKovitz" title="User talk:BenKovitz">talk</a>) 04:04, 19 April 2011 (UTC)</p>

Hi Ben,</p>
<p>To answer your question, this picture was taken in the office of my client, a financial company in Dallas. Please look closer, the two monitors display the same content. They are connected to the same workstation via signal splitter. This setup solved the problem of making two developers staying too close to each other. I can provide more detail about the setup if you are interested. Sorry for the confusion earlier. <small><span class="autosigned">— Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Yujunliang&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Yujunliang (page does not exist)">Yujunliang</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Yujunliang" title="User talk:Yujunliang">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Yujunliang" title="Special:Contributions/Yujunliang">contribs</a>) 00:54, 20 April 2011 (UTC)</span></small></p>

<p>Pairs usually complete work faster than one programmer assigned to the same task.<br>
&amp;<br>
Even though coding is often completed faster than when one programmer works alone, total programmer time (number of programmers × time spent) increases.<br>
Are contradictory, one claims pairs are faster and the other claims solo is faster, I believe the intention in the second sentence was: Even though coding is often completed faster than when two programmers work together, total programmer time (number of programmers × time spent) increases. as this also seems to make more sense, due to the first version being redundant and, well wrong, I don't really know how to explain. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/193.105.7.54" title="Special:Contributions/193.105.7.54">193.105.7.54</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:193.105.7.54" title="User talk:193.105.7.54">talk</a>)</p>

<p>I've added the neutrality template to this article. It only includes advantages to this development method while the language reads almost like a sales pitch in some areas. Furthermore, the first 13 sources (more than half of the total) were written by the same author, most of which in the same publication. It looks as though the references count has been artificially inflated by counting each page of the same references as a separate reference entirely.</p>
<p>Concern was also raised here by another user about the fact that the "Costs and Benefits" section only contains benefits. That concern has never been addressed or even discussed since it was raised three months ago.</p>
<p>Because of the extremely poor quality of the article's citations and rather blatantly biased perspective, I've decided to add a couple other relevant templates as well. Please do not remove them until the issues raised here have been resolved. Some parts of the article may need to be rewritten so that they're not relying almost exclusively on a single source. <a href="/wiki/User:KrisCraig" title="User:KrisCraig">KrisCraig</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:KrisCraig&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:KrisCraig (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 03:23, 1 February 2013 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is there going to be any mention of how impersonal and dehumanizing p.p. can be? Any two random people in the West are likely to have vastly different work habits, and prolonged p.p. is going to make them hate each other. It goes against the grain of individual independence and freedom. Ever see two painters painting the same canvas? Two cooks making the same soup? Two equal drivers in a car? No, no, and no. I urge managers worldwide to stay away from or at least never enforce this hideous methodology. Collaboration and feedback are undoubtedly essential, but p.p. takes it to the extreme, and the extreme is always a dangerous place to be. When I'm programming, I like to be lost in my thoughts, think a problem through, feel that light bulb turn on, explore and experiment, and not be yapping with anybody else. Unless my pair is a 10/10 fine 6ft blonde, in which case I'll also be exploring and experimenting with her, I would rather be left to pair with myself. Remember, programmers are typically much more introverted than extroverted. --<a href="/wiki/User:IO_Device" title="User:IO Device">IO Device</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:IO_Device" title="User talk:IO Device">talk</a>) 23:48, 3 January 2014 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the Benefits section, it states "A correlation exists between satisfaction among programmers and their confidence in the codes i.e. the pairs enjoy their work more because they are more confident in it.". I do not have access to the referenced paper, but based on the text at hand, this is an invalid conclusion. Correlation between two things does not necessarily mean that one was caused by the other.
