<h1>Executors</h1>
<p>In all of the previous examples, there's a close connection between the task being done by a new thread, as defined by its <code>Runnable</code> object, and the thread itself, as defined by a <code>Thread</code> object. This works well for small applications, but in large-scale applications, it makes sense to separate thread management and creation from the rest of the application. Objects that encapsulate these functions are known as <i>executors</i>. The following subsections describe executors in detail.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="exinter.html">Executor Interfaces</a> define the three executor object types.</li>
<li><a href="pools.html">Thread Pools</a> are the most common kind of executor implementation.</li>
<li><a href="forkjoin.html">Fork/Join</a> is a framework (new in JDK 7) for taking advantage of multiple processors.</li>
</ul>
