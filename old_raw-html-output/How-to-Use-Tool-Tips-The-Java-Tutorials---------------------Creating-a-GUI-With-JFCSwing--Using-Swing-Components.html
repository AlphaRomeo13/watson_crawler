<h1>How to Use Tool Tips</h1>
<p>Creating a tool tip for any <code>JComponent</code> object is easy. Use the <code>setToolTipText</code> method to set up a tool tip for the component. For example, to add tool tips to three buttons, you add only three lines of code:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 72f1da36-44a2-49b9-acf7-9dfa6b14388a</p>
<pre>
b1.setToolTipText("Click this button to disable the middle button.");
b2.setToolTipText("This middle button does not react when you click it.");
b3.setToolTipText("Click this button to enable the middle button.");
</pre>
<p>When the user of the program pauses with the cursor over any of the program's buttons, the tool tip for the button comes up. You can see this by running the <code>ButtonDemo</code> example, which is explained in <a href="button.html">How to Use Buttons, Check Boxes, and Radio Buttons</a>. Here is a picture of the tool tip that appears when the cursor pauses over the left button in the <code>ButtonDemo</code> example.</p>
<p>For components such as tabbed panes that have multiple parts, it often makes sense to vary the tool tip text to reflect the part of the component under the cursor. For example, a tabbed pane might use this feature to explain what will happen when you click the tab under the cursor. When you implement a tabbed pane, you can specify the tab-specific tool tip text in an argument passed to the <code>addTab</code> or <code>setToolTipTextAt</code> method.</p>
<p>Even in components that have no API for setting part-specific tool tip text, you can generally do the job yourself. If the component supports renderers, then you can set the tool tip text on a custom renderer. The <a href="table.html">table</a> and <a href="tree.html">tree</a> sections provide examples of tool tip text determined by a custom renderer. An alternative that works for all <code>JComponent</code>s is creating a subclass of the component and overriding its <code>getToolTipText(MouseEvent)</code> method.</p>
<h2><a name="api" id="api">The Tool Tip API</a></h2>
<p>Most of the API you need in order to set up tool tips belongs to the <code>JComponent</code> class, and thus is inherited by most Swing components. More tool tip API can be found in individual classes such as <code>JTabbedPane</code>. In general, those APIs are sufficient for specifying and displaying tool tips; you usually do not need to deal directly with the implementing classes 
<a class="APILink" target="_blank" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/JToolTip.html"><code>JToolTip</code></a> and

<p>The following table lists the tool tip API in the <code>JComponent</code> class. For information on individual components' support for tool tips, see the how-to section for the component in question.</p>
