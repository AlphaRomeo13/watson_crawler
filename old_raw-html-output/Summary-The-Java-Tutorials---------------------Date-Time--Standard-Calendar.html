<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
The <tt>java.time</tt> package contains many classes that your programs can use to represent time and date. This is a very rich API. The key entry points for ISO-based dates are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <tt>Instant</tt> class provides a machine view of the timeline.</li>
<li>The <tt>LocalDate</tt>, <tt>LocalTime</tt>, and <tt>LocalDateTime</tt> classes provide a human view of date and time without any reference to time zone.</li>
<li>The <tt>ZoneId</tt>, <tt>ZoneRules</tt>, and <tt>ZoneOffset</tt> classes describe time zones, time zone offsets, and time zone rules.</li>
<li>The <tt>ZonedDateTime</tt> class represents date and time with a time zone. The <tt>OffsetDateTime</tt> and <tt>OffsetTime</tt> classes represent date and time, or time, respectively. These classes take a time zone offset into account.</li>
<li>The <tt>Duration</tt> class measures an amount of time in seconds and nanoseconds.</li>
<li>The <tt>Period</tt> class measures an amount of time using years, months, and days.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Other non-ISO calendar systems can be represented using the <tt>java.time.chrono</tt> package. This package is beyond the scope of this tutorial, though the
<a class="TutorialLink" target="_top" href="nonIso.html">Non-ISO Date Conversion</a> page provides information about converting an ISO-based date to another calendar system.</p>

The Date Time API was developed as part of the Java community process under the designation of JSR 310. For more information, see
