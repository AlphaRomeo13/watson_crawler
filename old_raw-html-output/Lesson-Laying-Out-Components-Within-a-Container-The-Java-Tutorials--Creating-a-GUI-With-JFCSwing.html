<h1>Lesson: Laying Out Components Within a Container</h1>
<p>
This lesson tells you how to use the layout managers
provided by the Java platform. It also tells you how to use absolute positioning (no layout manager)
and gives an example of writing a custom layout manager.
 
 For each layout manager (or lack thereof), this 
lesson
points to an example that you can run using Java™ Web Start. By resizing an example's window, you can see how size changes affect the layout.</p>

<p>Layout managers must implement the <code>LayoutManager</code> interface, which specifies the five methods every layout manager must define. Optionally, layout managers can implement <code>LayoutManager2</code>, which is a subinterface of <code>LayoutManager</code>.</p>

</h2>
<p>If necessary, you can position components without using a layout manager.  Generally, this solution is used to specify absolute sizes and positions for components.</p>

<p>Some of the most common layout problems involve components that are displayed too small  or not at all.
