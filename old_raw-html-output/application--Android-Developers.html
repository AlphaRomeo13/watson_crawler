The
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html">&lt;activity&gt;</a></code>
element has its own
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html#reparent">allowTaskReparenting</a></code>
attribute that can override the value set here.  See that attribute for more
information.
</p>
<p>
There is no default.  The name must be specified.
</p>
<p>The system uses the banner to represent an app in
the Android TV home screen. Since the banner is displayed only in the home screen, it
should only be specified by applications with an activity that handles the
<code><a href="/reference/android/content/Intent.html#CATEGORY_LEANBACK_LAUNCHER">CATEGORY_LEANBACK_LAUNCHER</a></code> intent.</p>
<p>This attribute must be set as a reference to a drawable resource containing
the image (for example <code>"@drawable/banner"</code>). There is no default banner.
</p>
<p>
See <a href="/design/tv/patterns.html#banner">
Banners</a> in the UI Patterns for TV design guide, and <a href="/training/tv/start/start.html#banner">
Provide a home screen banner</a> in Get Started with TV Apps for more information.
</p>
<p>
The default value is <code>"true"</code>.
</p>
<p>
An application would not have any code of its own only if it's using nothing
but built-in component classes, such as an activity that uses the <code><a href="/reference/android/app/AliasActivity.html">AliasActivity</a></code> class, a rare occurrence.</p>
<p>Starting from Android 3.0 (API level 11), a hardware-accelerated OpenGL renderer is
available to applications, to improve performance for many common 2D graphics
operations. When the hardware-accelerated renderer is enabled, most operations
in Canvas, Paint, Xfermode, ColorFilter, Shader, and Camera are accelerated.
This results in smoother animations, smoother scrolling, and improved
responsiveness overall, even for applications that do not explicitly make use
the framework's OpenGL libraries. </p>
<p>Note that not all of the OpenGL 2D operations are accelerated. If you enable
the hardware-accelerated renderer, test your application to ensure that it can
make use of the renderer without errors.</p>
<p>For more information, read the <a href="/guide/topics/graphics/hardware-accel.html">Hardware Acceleration</a> guide.</p>
<p>
This attribute must be set as a reference to a drawable resource containing
the image (for example <code>"@drawable/icon"</code>). There is no default icon.
</p>
<p>The default is <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>The default is <code>true</code>, which means that after the application
has finished processing its data during a full-system restore, it will be
terminated.
</p>
<p>Most apps should not need this and should instead focus on reducing their overall memory usage for
improved performance. Enabling this also does not guarantee a fixed increase in available memory,
because some devices are constrained by their total available memory.</p>
<p>To query the available memory size at runtime, use the methods <code><a href="/reference/android/app/ActivityManager.html#getMemoryClass()">getMemoryClass()</a></code> or <code><a href="/reference/android/app/ActivityManager.html#getLargeMemoryClass()">getLargeMemoryClass()</a></code>.</p>
<p>
The label should be set as a reference to a string resource, so that
it can be localized like other strings in the user interface.
However, as a convenience while you're developing the application,
it can also be set as a raw string.
</p>
<p>This attribute must be set as a reference to a drawable resource containing
the image (for example <code>"@drawable/logo"</code>).  There is no default logo.</p>
<p>
The subclass is optional; most applications won't need one.
In the absence of a subclass, Android uses an instance of the base
Application class.

</p>
<p>
By default, Android creates a process for an application when the first
of its components needs to run.  All components then run in that process.
The name of the default process matches the package name set by the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element.html">&lt;manifest&gt;</a></code> element.
</p>
<p>By setting this attribute to a process name that's shared with another
application, you can arrange for components of both applications to run in
the same process — but only if the two applications also share a
user ID and be signed with the same certificate.
</p>
<p>
If the name assigned to this attribute begins with a colon (':'), a new
process, private to the application, is created when it's needed.
If the process name begins with a lowercase character, a global process
of that name is created.  A global process can be shared with other
applications, reducing resource usage.
</p>
<p>The default value of this attribute is <code>false</code>.
</p>
<p>The default value is null and indicates that the application
can work <em>without</em> any accounts.

</p>
<p>Because restricted profiles currently
cannot add accounts, specifying this attribute <strong>makes your app
unavailable from a restricted profile</strong> unless you also declare
<a href="#restrictedAccountType"><code>android:restrictedAccountType</code></a> with
the same value.</p>
<p class="caution"><strong>Caution:</strong>
If the account data may reveal personally identifiable information, it's important
that you declare this attribute and leave <a href="#restrictedAccountType"><code>android:restrictedAccountType</code></a> null, so that restricted profiles cannot use
your app to access personal information that belongs to the owner user.</p>
<p>This attribute was added in API level 18.</p>
<p>The default value is null and indicates that the application can work <em>without</em> any
accounts.

</p>
<p class="caution"><strong>Caution:</strong>
Specifying this attribute allows restricted profiles to use your
app with accounts that belong to the owner user, which may reveal personally identifiable
information. If the account may reveal personal details, you <strong>should not</strong>
use this attribute and you should instead declare the <a href="#requiredAccountType"><code>android:requiredAccountType</code></a> attribute
to make your app unavailable to restricted profiles.</p>
<p>This attribute was added in API level 18.</p>
<p>If set to <code>true</code> and <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#target"><code>targetSdkVersion</code></a> is set to 17 or higher, various RTL APIs will be
activated and used by the system so your app can display RTL layouts.
If set to <code>false</code> or if <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#target"><code>targetSdkVersion</code></a> is set to 16 or lower, the RTL APIs will be ignored
or will have no effect and your app will behave the same regardless of the layout
direction associated to the user's Locale choice (your layouts will always be left-to-right).

</p>
<p>The default value of this attribute is <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>This attribute was added in API level 17.</p>
<p>
By default, all activities within an application share the same
affinity.  The name of that affinity is the same as the package name
set by the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element.html">&lt;manifest&gt;</a></code> element.
</p>
<p>Must be one of the following values.</p>

<p>This attribute was added in API level 14.</p>
