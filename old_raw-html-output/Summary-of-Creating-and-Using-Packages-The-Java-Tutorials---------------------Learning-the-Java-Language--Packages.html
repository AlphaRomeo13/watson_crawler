<h1>Summary of Creating and Using Packages</h1>
<p>To create a package for a type, put a <code>package</code> statement as the first statement in the source file that contains the type (class, interface, enumeration, or annotation type).</p>
<p>To use a public type that's in a different package, you have three choices: (1) use the fully qualified name of the type, (2) import the type, or (3) import the entire package of which the type is a member.</p>
<p>The path names for a package's source and class files mirror the name of the package.</p>
<p>You might have to set your <code>CLASSPATH</code> so that the compiler and the JVM can find the <code>.class</code> files for your types.</p>
