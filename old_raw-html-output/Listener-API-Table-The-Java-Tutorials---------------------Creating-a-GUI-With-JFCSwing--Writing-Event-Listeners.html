<h1>Listener API Table</h1>
<p>In the table that follows, the first column gives the name of the listener interface, with either a link to the tutorial page that discusses the listener or, if the tutorial doesn't discuss the listener, a link to the API docs. The second column names the corresponding adapter class, if any. (For a discussion of using adapters, see <a href="generalrules.html#innerClasses">Using Adapters and Inner Classes to Handle Events</a>.) The third column lists the methods that the listener interface contains and shows the type of the event object passed into the method. Typically, the listener, the adapter, and the event type have the same name prefix, but this is not always the case.</p>
<p>To see which Swing components can fire which kinds of events, see <a href="eventsandcomponents.html">Listeners Supported by Swing Components</a>.</p>
