&lt;/activity&gt;</pre>
<p>The default value of this attribute is <code>false</code>.
</p>
<p>
If this attribute is not set, the value set by the corresponding
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#reparent">allowTaskReparenting</a></code>
attribute of the <code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code> element
applies to the activity.  The default value is "<code>false</code>".
</p>
<p>
Normally when an activity is started, it's associated with the task of
the activity that started it and it stays there for its entire lifetime.
You can use this attribute to force it to be re-parented to the task it
has an affinity for when its current task is no longer displayed.
Typically, it's used to cause the activities of an application to move
to the main task associated with that application.
</p>
<p>
For example, if an e-mail message contains a link to a web page, clicking
the link brings up an activity that can display the page.  That activity
is defined by the browser application, but is launched as part of the e-mail
task.  If it's reparented to the browser task, it will be shown when the
browser next comes to the front, and will be absent when the e-mail task
again comes forward.
</p>
<p>
The affinity of an activity is defined by the
<code><a href="#aff">taskAffinity</a></code> attribute.  The affinity
of a task is determined by reading the affinity of its root activity.
Therefore, by definition, a root activity is always in a task with the
same affinity.  Since activities with "<code>singleTask</code>" or
"<code>singleInstance</code>" launch modes can only be at the root of a task,
re-parenting is limited to the "<code>standard</code>" and "<code>singleTop</code>"
modes.  (See also the <code><a href="#lmode">launchMode</a></code>
attribute.)
</p>
<p>
Normally, the system clears a task (removes all activities from the stack
above the root activity) in certain situations when the user re-selects that
task from the home screen.  Typically, this is done if the user hasn't visited
the task for a certain amount of time, such as 30 minutes.
</p>
<p>
However, when this attribute is "<code>true</code>", users will always return
to the task in its last state, regardless of how they get there.  This is
useful, for example, in an application like the web browser where there is
a lot of state (such as multiple open tabs) that users would not like to lose.
</p>
<p>The system uses the banner to represent an app in
the Android TV home screen. Since the banner is displayed only in the home screen, it
should only be specified by applications with an activity that handles the
<code><a href="/reference/android/content/Intent.html#CATEGORY_LEANBACK_LAUNCHER">CATEGORY_LEANBACK_LAUNCHER</a></code> intent.</p>
<p>This attribute must be set as a reference to a drawable resource containing
the image (for example <code>"@drawable/banner"</code>). There is no default banner.
</p>
<p>
See <a href="/design/tv/patterns.html#banner">
Banners</a> in the UI Patterns for TV design guide, and <a href="/training/tv/start/start.html#banner">
Provide a home screen banner</a> in Get Started with TV Apps for more information.
</p>
<p>
When the value is "<code>true</code>", every time users start the task again, they
are brought to its root activity regardless of what they were last doing in
the task and regardless of whether they used the <em>Back</em> or <em>Home</em> button to
leave it. When the value is "<code>false</code>", the task may be cleared of activities in
some situations (see the
<code><a href="#always">alwaysRetainTaskState</a></code> attribute), but not always.
</p>
<p>
Suppose, for example, that someone launches activity P from the home screen,
and from there goes to activity Q.  The user next presses <em>Home</em>, and then returns
to activity P.  Normally, the user would see activity Q, since that is what they
were last doing in P's task.  However, if P set this flag to "<code>true</code>", all
of the activities on top of it (Q in this case) were removed when the user pressed
<em>Home</em> and the task went to the background.  So the user sees only P when returning
to the task.
</p>
<p>
If this attribute and <code><a href="#reparent">allowTaskReparenting</a></code>
are both "<code>true</code>", any activities that can be re-parented are moved to
the task they share an affinity with; the remaining activities are then dropped,
as described above.
</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Using this attribute should be
avoided and used only as a last resort. Please read <a href="/guide/topics/resources/runtime-changes.html">Handling Runtime Changes</a> for more
information about how to properly handle a restart due to a configuration change.</p>
<p>
Any or all of the following strings are valid values for this attribute. Multiple values are
separated by '<code>|</code>' — for example, "<code>locale|navigation|orientation</code>".
</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If your application targets API level 13 or higher (as
declared by the <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#min"><code>minSdkVersion</code></a> and <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#target"><code>targetSdkVersion</code></a> attributes), then you should also declare the <code>"screenSize"</code>
configuration, because it also changes when a device switches between portrait and landscape
orientations.</p>
<p><em>Added in API level 13.</em></p>
<p><em>Added in API level 13.</em></p>
<p>
All of these configuration changes can impact the resource values seen by the
application.  Therefore, when <code><code><a href="/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onConfigurationChanged(android.content.res.Configuration)">onConfigurationChanged()</a></code></code> is called, it will generally be necessary to again
retrieve all resources (including view layouts, drawables, and so on) to correctly
handle the change.
</p>
<p>This attribute has four values which produce the following effects when the user opens a document
with the application:</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For values other than "<code>none</code>" and "<code>never</code>" the
activity must be defined with <code>launchMode="standard"</code>. If this attribute is not specified,
<code>documentLaunchMode="none"</code> is used.</p>
<p>
The <code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a>
</code> element has its own<code>
<a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#enabled">enabled</a></code>
attribute that applies to all application components, including activities.  The
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code>
and <code>&lt;activity&gt;</code> attributes must both be "<code>true</code>" (as they both
are by default) for the system to be able to instantiate the activity.  If either
is "<code>false</code>", it cannot be instantiated.
</p>
<p>
The default value depends on whether the activity contains intent filters.  The
absence of any filters means that the activity can be invoked only by specifying
its exact class name.  This implies that the activity is intended only for
application-internal use (since others would not know the class name).  So in
this case, the default value is "<code>false</code>".
On the other hand, the presence of at least one filter implies that the activity
is intended for external use, so the default value is "<code>true</code>".
</p>
<p>
This attribute is not the only way to limit an activity's exposure to other
applications.  You can also use a permission to limit the external entities that
can invoke the activity  (see the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html#prmsn">permission</a></code>
attribute).
</p>
<p>
If this attribute and
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html#reparent">allowTaskReparenting</a></code>
are both "<code>true</code>", this attribute trumps the other.  The affinity of the
activity is ignored.  The activity is not re-parented, but destroyed.
</p>
<p>Starting from Android 3.0, a hardware-accelerated OpenGL renderer is
available to applications, to improve performance for many common 2D graphics
operations. When the hardware-accelerated renderer is enabled, most operations
in Canvas, Paint, Xfermode, ColorFilter, Shader, and Camera are accelerated.
This results in smoother animations, smoother scrolling, and improved
responsiveness overall, even for applications that do not explicitly make use
the framework's OpenGL libraries. Because of the increased resources required to
enable hardware acceleration, your app will consume more RAM.</p>
<p>Note that not all of the OpenGL 2D operations are accelerated. If you enable
the hardware-accelerated renderer, test your application to ensure that it can
make use of the renderer without errors.</p>
<p>
This attribute must be set as a reference to a drawable resource containing
the image definition.  If it is not set, the icon specified for the application
as a whole is used instead (see the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code>
element's <code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#icon">icon</a></code> attribute).
</p>
<p>
The activity's icon — whether set here or by the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code>
element — is also the default icon for all the activity's intent filters (see the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/intent-filter-element.html">&lt;intent-filter&gt;</a></code> element's
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/intent-filter-element.html#icon">icon</a></code> attribute).
</p>
<p>
If this attribute is not set, the label set for the application as a whole is
used instead (see the <code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code> element's
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#label">label</a></code> attribute).
</p>
<p>
The activity's label — whether set here or by the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code> element — is also the
default label for all the activity's intent filters (see the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/intent-filter-element.html">&lt;intent-filter&gt;</a></code> element's
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/intent-filter-element.html#label">label</a></code> attribute).
</p>
<p>
The label should be set as a reference to a string resource, so that
it can be localized like other strings in the user interface.
However, as a convenience while you're developing the application,
it can also be set as a raw string.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em">"<code>standard</code>"
<br>"<code>singleTop</code>"
<br>"<code>singleTask</code>"
<br>"<code>singleInstance</code>"</p>
<p>
The default mode is "<code>standard</code>".
</p>
<p>
As shown in the table below, the modes fall into two main groups, with
"<code>standard</code>" and "<code>singleTop</code>" activities on one side, and
"<code>singleTask</code>" and "<code>singleInstance</code>" activities on the other.
An activity with the "<code>standard</code>" or "<code>singleTop</code>" launch mode
can be instantiated multiple times.  The instances can belong to any task
and can be located anywhere in the activity stack.  Typically, they're
launched into the task that called
<code><code><a href="/reference/android/content/Context.html#startActivity(android.content.Intent)">startActivity()</a></code></code>
(unless the Intent object contains a
<code><code><a href="/reference/android/content/Intent.html#FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK">FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK</a></code></code>
instruction, in which case a different task is chosen — see the
<a href="#aff">taskAffinity</a> attribute).
</p>
<p>
In contrast, "<code>singleTask</code>" and "<code>singleInstance</code>" activities
can only begin a task.  They are always at the root of the activity stack.
Moreover, the device can hold only one instance of the activity at a time
— only one such task.
</p>
<p>
The "<code>standard</code>" and "<code>singleTop</code>" modes differ from each other
in just one respect:  Every time there's a new intent for a "<code>standard</code>"
activity, a new instance of the class is created to respond to that intent.
Each instance handles a single intent.
Similarly, a new instance of a "<code>singleTop</code>" activity may also be
created to handle a new intent.  However, if the target task already has an
existing instance of the activity at the top of its stack, that instance
will receive the new intent (in an
<code><a href="/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onNewIntent(android.content.Intent)">onNewIntent()</a></code> call);
a new instance is not created.
In other circumstances — for example, if an existing instance of the
"<code>singleTop</code>" activity is in the target task, but not at the top of
the stack, or if it's at the top of a stack, but not in the target task
— a new instance would be created and pushed on the stack.
</p>
<p>Similarly, if you
<a href="/training/implementing-navigation/ancestral.html">navigate
up</a> to an activity on the current stack, the behavior is determined by the
parent activity's launch mode. If the parent activity has launch mode <code>singleTop</code> (or the <code>up</code> intent contains <code><a href="/reference/android/content/Intent.html#FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP">FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP</a></code>), the parent is brought to the
top of the stack, and its state is preserved. The navigation intent is received
by the parent activity's <code><a href="/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onNewIntent(android.content.Intent)">onNewIntent()</a></code>
method.  If the parent activity has launch mode <code>standard</code> (and the
<code>up</code> intent does not contain <code><a href="/reference/android/content/Intent.html#FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP">FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP</a></code>), the current activity and its
parent are both popped off the stack, and a new instance of the parent activity
is created to receive the navigation intent.
</p>
<p>
The "<code>singleTask</code>" and "<code>singleInstance</code>" modes also differ from
each other in only one respect:  A "<code>singleTask</code>" activity allows other
activities to be part of its task. It's always at the root of its task, but
other activities (necessarily "<code>standard</code>" and "<code>singleTop</code>"
activities) can be launched into that task.  A "<code>singleInstance</code>"
activity, on the other hand, permits no other activities to be part of its task.
It's the only activity in the task.  If it starts another activity, that
activity is assigned to a different task — as if <code>FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK</code> was in the intent.
</p>
<p>As shown in the table above, <code>standard</code> is the default mode and is
appropriate for most types of activities. <code>SingleTop</code> is also a
common and useful launch mode for many types of activities. The other modes
— <code>singleTask</code> and <code>singleInstance</code> — are
<span style="color:red">not appropriate for most applications</span>,
since they result in an interaction model that is likely to be unfamiliar to
users and is very different from most other applications.

</p>
<p>Regardless of the launch mode that you choose, make sure to test the usability
of the activity during launch and when navigating back to it from
other activities and tasks using the <em>Back</em> button. </p>
<p>For more information on launch modes and their interaction with Intent
flags, see the
<a href="/guide/components/tasks-and-back-stack.html">Tasks and Back Stack</a>
document.
</p>
<p>
Normally, a new instance of an activity is launched into the process of the
application that defined it, so all instances of the activity run in the same
process.  However, if this flag is set to "<code>true</code>", instances of the
activity can run in multiple processes, allowing the system to create instances
wherever they are used (provided permissions allow it), something that is almost
never necessary or desirable.
</p>
<p>Once you publish your application, you <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/06/things-that-cannot-change.html">should not
change this name</a> (unless you've set <code><a href="#exported">android:exported</a>="false"</code>).</p>
<p>
There is no default.  The name must be specified.
</p>
<p>
A value of "<code>true</code>" means that the activity will not leave a
historical trace.  It will not remain in the activity stack for the task,
so the user will not be able to return to it.
</p>
<p>
This attribute was introduced in API Level 3.
</p>
<p>The system reads this attribute to determine which activity should be started when
  the user presses the Up button in the action bar. The system can also use this information to
  synthesize a back stack of activities with <code><a href="/reference/android/app/TaskStackBuilder.html">TaskStackBuilder</a></code>.</p>
<p>To support API levels 4 - 16, you can also declare the parent activity with a <code>&lt;meta-data&gt;</code> element that specifies a value for <code>"android.support.PARENT_ACTIVITY"</code>.
For example:</p>
<p>WHATSON? cfcca511-746a-491e-88f7-fdd164b74298</p>
<pre>
&lt;activity
    android:name="com.example.app.ChildActivity"
    android:label="@string/title_child_activity"
    android:parentActivityName="com.example.myfirstapp.MainActivity" &gt;
    &lt;!-- Parent activity meta-data to support API level 4+ --&gt;
    &lt;meta-data
        android:name="android.support.PARENT_ACTIVITY"
        android:value="com.example.app.MainActivity" /&gt;
&lt;/activity&gt;
</pre>
<p>For more information about declaring the parent activity to support Up navigation,
read <a href="/training/implementing-navigation/ancestral.html">Providing Up
Navigation</a>.</p>
<p>
This attribute was introduced in API Level 16.
</p>
<p>
If this attribute is not set, the permission set by the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code>
element's
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#prmsn">permission</a></code>
attribute applies to the activity.  If neither attribute is set, the activity is
not protected by a permission.
</p>
<p>
For more information on permissions, see the
<a href="/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html#sectperm">Permissions</a>
section in the introduction and another document,
<a href="/guide/topics/security/security.html">Security and
Permissions</a>.
</p>
<p>
If the name assigned to this attribute begins with a colon (':'), a new
process, private to the application, is created when it's needed and
the activity runs in that process.
If the process name begins with a lowercase character, the activity will run
in a global process of that name, provided that it has permission to do so.
This allows components in different applications to share a process, reducing
resource usage.
</p>
<p>The <code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code> element's
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#proc">process</a></code>
attribute can set a different default process name for all components.
</p>
<p>This attribute set to "<code>true</code>" also permits the activity's use of the
<code><a href="/reference/android/app/ActivityManager.TaskDescription.html">ActivityManager.TaskDescription</a></code> to change labels, colors
and icons in the <a href="/guide/components/recents.html">overview screen</a>.</p>
<p>The value can be any one of the following strings:</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When you declare one of the landscape or portrait values,
it is considered a hard requirement for the orientation in which the activity runs. As such,
the value you declare enables filtering by services such as Google Play so your application is
available only to devices that support the orientation required by your activities. For
example, if you declare either <code>"landscape"</code>, <code>"reverseLandscape"</code>, or
<code>"sensorLandscape"</code>, then your application will be available only to devices that support
landscape orientation. However, you should also explicitly declare that
your application requires either portrait or landscape orientation with the <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/uses-feature-element.html"><code>&lt;uses-feature&gt;</code></a>
element. For example, <code>&lt;uses-feature
android:name="android.hardware.screen.portrait"/&gt;</code>. This is purely a filtering behavior
provided by Google Play (and other services that support it) and the platform itself does not
control whether your app can be installed when a device supports only certain orientations.</p>
<p>
Normally, before an activity is temporarily shut down to save resources, its
<code><code><a href="/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onSaveInstanceState(android.os.Bundle)">onSaveInstanceState()</a></code></code>
method is called.  This method stores the current state of the activity in a
<code><a href="/reference/android/os/Bundle.html">Bundle</a></code> object, which is then passed to
<code><code><a href="/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onCreate(android.os.Bundle)">onCreate()</a></code></code> when the activity
is restarted.  If this attribute is set to "<code>true</code>",
<code>onSaveInstanceState()</code> may not be called and <code>onCreate()</code> will
be passed <code>null</code> instead of the Bundle — just as it was when the
activity started for the first time.
</p>
<p>
A "<code>true</code>" setting ensures that the activity can be restarted in the
absence of retained state.  For example, the activity that displays the
home screen uses this setting to make sure that it does not get removed if it
crashes for some reason.
</p>
<p>
The affinity determines two things — the task that the activity is re-parented
to (see the <code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html#reparent">allowTaskReparenting</a></code>
attribute) and the task that will house the activity when it is launched
with the <code><code><a href="/reference/android/content/Intent.html#FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK">FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK</a></code></code>
flag.
</p>
<p>
By default, all activities in an application have the same affinity.  You
can set this attribute to group them differently, and even place
activities defined in different applications within the same task.  To
specify that the activity does not have an affinity for any task, set
it to an empty string.

</p>
<p>
If this attribute is not set, the activity inherits the affinity set
for the application (see the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code>
element's
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#aff">taskAffinity</a></code>
attribute).  The name of the default affinity for an application is
the package name set by the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element.html">&lt;manifest&gt;</a></code>
element.
</p>
<p>
If this attribute is not set, the activity inherits the theme set for the
application as a whole — from the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code>
element's
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#theme">theme</a></code>
attribute.  If that attribute is also not set, the default system theme is used. For more
information, see the <a href="/guide/topics/ui/themes.html">Styles and Themes</a> developer guide.
</p>
<p>Must be one of the following values.</p>
<p>For more information about the action bar, see the <a href="/guide/topics/ui/actionbar.html">Action Bar</a> developer guide.</p>
<p>This attribute was added in API level 14.</p>
<ul>
<li>The state of the soft keyboard — whether it is hidden or visible
— when the activity becomes the focus of user attention.</li>

<li>The adjustment made to the activity's main window — whether it is
resized smaller to make room for the soft keyboard or whether its contents
pan to make the current focus visible when part of the window is covered by
the soft keyboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The setting must be one of the values listed in the following table, or a
combination of one "<code>state...</code>" value plus one "<code>adjust...</code>"
value.  Setting multiple values in either group — multiple
"<code>state...</code>" values, for example — has undefined results.
Individual values are separated by a vertical bar (<code>|</code>).  For example:
</p>
<p>WHATSON? 89284252-d0a1-4481-a47f-1d1c1e94f07f</p>
<pre>&lt;activity android:windowSoftInputMode="stateVisible|adjustResize" . . . &gt;</pre>
<p>
Values set here (other than "<code>stateUnspecified</code>" and
"<code>adjustUnspecified</code>") override values set in the theme.
</p>
<p>
       This is the default setting for the behavior of the soft keyboard.
       </p>
<p>
       This is the default setting for the behavior of the main window.
       </p>
<p>
This attribute was introduced in API Level 3.

    . . .
&lt;/activity&gt;</pre>
<p>The default value of this attribute is <code>false</code>.
</p>
<p>
If this attribute is not set, the value set by the corresponding
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#reparent">allowTaskReparenting</a></code>
attribute of the <code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code> element
applies to the activity.  The default value is "<code>false</code>".
</p>
<p>
Normally when an activity is started, it's associated with the task of
the activity that started it and it stays there for its entire lifetime.
You can use this attribute to force it to be re-parented to the task it
has an affinity for when its current task is no longer displayed.
Typically, it's used to cause the activities of an application to move
to the main task associated with that application.
</p>
<p>
For example, if an e-mail message contains a link to a web page, clicking
the link brings up an activity that can display the page.  That activity
is defined by the browser application, but is launched as part of the e-mail
task.  If it's reparented to the browser task, it will be shown when the
browser next comes to the front, and will be absent when the e-mail task
again comes forward.
</p>
<p>
The affinity of an activity is defined by the
<code><a href="#aff">taskAffinity</a></code> attribute.  The affinity
of a task is determined by reading the affinity of its root activity.
Therefore, by definition, a root activity is always in a task with the
same affinity.  Since activities with "<code>singleTask</code>" or
"<code>singleInstance</code>" launch modes can only be at the root of a task,
re-parenting is limited to the "<code>standard</code>" and "<code>singleTop</code>"
modes.  (See also the <code><a href="#lmode">launchMode</a></code>
attribute.)
</p>
<p>
Normally, the system clears a task (removes all activities from the stack
above the root activity) in certain situations when the user re-selects that
task from the home screen.  Typically, this is done if the user hasn't visited
the task for a certain amount of time, such as 30 minutes.
</p>
<p>
However, when this attribute is "<code>true</code>", users will always return
to the task in its last state, regardless of how they get there.  This is
useful, for example, in an application like the web browser where there is
a lot of state (such as multiple open tabs) that users would not like to lose.
</p>
<p>The system uses the banner to represent an app in
the Android TV home screen. Since the banner is displayed only in the home screen, it
should only be specified by applications with an activity that handles the
<code><a href="/reference/android/content/Intent.html#CATEGORY_LEANBACK_LAUNCHER">CATEGORY_LEANBACK_LAUNCHER</a></code> intent.</p>
<p>This attribute must be set as a reference to a drawable resource containing
the image (for example <code>"@drawable/banner"</code>). There is no default banner.
</p>
<p>
See <a href="/design/tv/patterns.html#banner">
Banners</a> in the UI Patterns for TV design guide, and <a href="/training/tv/start/start.html#banner">
Provide a home screen banner</a> in Get Started with TV Apps for more information.
</p>
<p>
When the value is "<code>true</code>", every time users start the task again, they
are brought to its root activity regardless of what they were last doing in
the task and regardless of whether they used the <em>Back</em> or <em>Home</em> button to
leave it. When the value is "<code>false</code>", the task may be cleared of activities in
some situations (see the
<code><a href="#always">alwaysRetainTaskState</a></code> attribute), but not always.
</p>
<p>
Suppose, for example, that someone launches activity P from the home screen,
and from there goes to activity Q.  The user next presses <em>Home</em>, and then returns
to activity P.  Normally, the user would see activity Q, since that is what they
were last doing in P's task.  However, if P set this flag to "<code>true</code>", all
of the activities on top of it (Q in this case) were removed when the user pressed
<em>Home</em> and the task went to the background.  So the user sees only P when returning
to the task.
</p>
<p>
If this attribute and <code><a href="#reparent">allowTaskReparenting</a></code>
are both "<code>true</code>", any activities that can be re-parented are moved to
the task they share an affinity with; the remaining activities are then dropped,
as described above.
</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Using this attribute should be
avoided and used only as a last resort. Please read <a href="/guide/topics/resources/runtime-changes.html">Handling Runtime Changes</a> for more
information about how to properly handle a restart due to a configuration change.</p>
<p>
Any or all of the following strings are valid values for this attribute. Multiple values are
separated by '<code>|</code>' — for example, "<code>locale|navigation|orientation</code>".
</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If your application targets API level 13 or higher (as
declared by the <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#min"><code>minSdkVersion</code></a> and <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#target"><code>targetSdkVersion</code></a> attributes), then you should also declare the <code>"screenSize"</code>
configuration, because it also changes when a device switches between portrait and landscape
orientations.</p>
<p><em>Added in API level 13.</em></p>
<p><em>Added in API level 13.</em></p>
<p>
All of these configuration changes can impact the resource values seen by the
application.  Therefore, when <code><code><a href="/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onConfigurationChanged(android.content.res.Configuration)">onConfigurationChanged()</a></code></code> is called, it will generally be necessary to again
retrieve all resources (including view layouts, drawables, and so on) to correctly
handle the change.
</p>
<p>This attribute has four values which produce the following effects when the user opens a document
with the application:</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For values other than "<code>none</code>" and "<code>never</code>" the
activity must be defined with <code>launchMode="standard"</code>. If this attribute is not specified,
<code>documentLaunchMode="none"</code> is used.</p>
<p>
The <code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a>
</code> element has its own<code>
<a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#enabled">enabled</a></code>
attribute that applies to all application components, including activities.  The
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code>
and <code>&lt;activity&gt;</code> attributes must both be "<code>true</code>" (as they both
are by default) for the system to be able to instantiate the activity.  If either
is "<code>false</code>", it cannot be instantiated.
</p>
<p>
The default value depends on whether the activity contains intent filters.  The
absence of any filters means that the activity can be invoked only by specifying
its exact class name.  This implies that the activity is intended only for
application-internal use (since others would not know the class name).  So in
this case, the default value is "<code>false</code>".
On the other hand, the presence of at least one filter implies that the activity
is intended for external use, so the default value is "<code>true</code>".
</p>
<p>
This attribute is not the only way to limit an activity's exposure to other
applications.  You can also use a permission to limit the external entities that
can invoke the activity  (see the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html#prmsn">permission</a></code>
attribute).
</p>
<p>
If this attribute and
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html#reparent">allowTaskReparenting</a></code>
are both "<code>true</code>", this attribute trumps the other.  The affinity of the
activity is ignored.  The activity is not re-parented, but destroyed.
</p>
<p>Starting from Android 3.0, a hardware-accelerated OpenGL renderer is
available to applications, to improve performance for many common 2D graphics
operations. When the hardware-accelerated renderer is enabled, most operations
in Canvas, Paint, Xfermode, ColorFilter, Shader, and Camera are accelerated.
This results in smoother animations, smoother scrolling, and improved
responsiveness overall, even for applications that do not explicitly make use
the framework's OpenGL libraries. Because of the increased resources required to
enable hardware acceleration, your app will consume more RAM.</p>
<p>Note that not all of the OpenGL 2D operations are accelerated. If you enable
the hardware-accelerated renderer, test your application to ensure that it can
make use of the renderer without errors.</p>
<p>
This attribute must be set as a reference to a drawable resource containing
the image definition.  If it is not set, the icon specified for the application
as a whole is used instead (see the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code>
element's <code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#icon">icon</a></code> attribute).
</p>
<p>
The activity's icon — whether set here or by the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code>
element — is also the default icon for all the activity's intent filters (see the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/intent-filter-element.html">&lt;intent-filter&gt;</a></code> element's
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/intent-filter-element.html#icon">icon</a></code> attribute).
</p>
<p>
If this attribute is not set, the label set for the application as a whole is
used instead (see the <code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code> element's
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#label">label</a></code> attribute).
</p>
<p>
The activity's label — whether set here or by the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code> element — is also the
default label for all the activity's intent filters (see the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/intent-filter-element.html">&lt;intent-filter&gt;</a></code> element's
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/intent-filter-element.html#label">label</a></code> attribute).
</p>
<p>
The label should be set as a reference to a string resource, so that
it can be localized like other strings in the user interface.
However, as a convenience while you're developing the application,
it can also be set as a raw string.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em">"<code>standard</code>"
<br>"<code>singleTop</code>"
<br>"<code>singleTask</code>"
<br>"<code>singleInstance</code>"</p>
<p>
The default mode is "<code>standard</code>".
</p>
<p>
As shown in the table below, the modes fall into two main groups, with
"<code>standard</code>" and "<code>singleTop</code>" activities on one side, and
"<code>singleTask</code>" and "<code>singleInstance</code>" activities on the other.
An activity with the "<code>standard</code>" or "<code>singleTop</code>" launch mode
can be instantiated multiple times.  The instances can belong to any task
and can be located anywhere in the activity stack.  Typically, they're
launched into the task that called
<code><code><a href="/reference/android/content/Context.html#startActivity(android.content.Intent)">startActivity()</a></code></code>
(unless the Intent object contains a
<code><code><a href="/reference/android/content/Intent.html#FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK">FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK</a></code></code>
instruction, in which case a different task is chosen — see the
<a href="#aff">taskAffinity</a> attribute).
</p>
<p>
In contrast, "<code>singleTask</code>" and "<code>singleInstance</code>" activities
can only begin a task.  They are always at the root of the activity stack.
Moreover, the device can hold only one instance of the activity at a time
— only one such task.
</p>
<p>
The "<code>standard</code>" and "<code>singleTop</code>" modes differ from each other
in just one respect:  Every time there's a new intent for a "<code>standard</code>"
activity, a new instance of the class is created to respond to that intent.
Each instance handles a single intent.
Similarly, a new instance of a "<code>singleTop</code>" activity may also be
created to handle a new intent.  However, if the target task already has an
existing instance of the activity at the top of its stack, that instance
will receive the new intent (in an
<code><a href="/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onNewIntent(android.content.Intent)">onNewIntent()</a></code> call);
a new instance is not created.
In other circumstances — for example, if an existing instance of the
"<code>singleTop</code>" activity is in the target task, but not at the top of
the stack, or if it's at the top of a stack, but not in the target task
— a new instance would be created and pushed on the stack.
</p>
<p>Similarly, if you
<a href="/training/implementing-navigation/ancestral.html">navigate
up</a> to an activity on the current stack, the behavior is determined by the
parent activity's launch mode. If the parent activity has launch mode <code>singleTop</code> (or the <code>up</code> intent contains <code><a href="/reference/android/content/Intent.html#FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP">FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP</a></code>), the parent is brought to the
top of the stack, and its state is preserved. The navigation intent is received
by the parent activity's <code><a href="/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onNewIntent(android.content.Intent)">onNewIntent()</a></code>
method.  If the parent activity has launch mode <code>standard</code> (and the
<code>up</code> intent does not contain <code><a href="/reference/android/content/Intent.html#FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP">FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP</a></code>), the current activity and its
parent are both popped off the stack, and a new instance of the parent activity
is created to receive the navigation intent.
</p>
<p>
The "<code>singleTask</code>" and "<code>singleInstance</code>" modes also differ from
each other in only one respect:  A "<code>singleTask</code>" activity allows other
activities to be part of its task. It's always at the root of its task, but
other activities (necessarily "<code>standard</code>" and "<code>singleTop</code>"
activities) can be launched into that task.  A "<code>singleInstance</code>"
activity, on the other hand, permits no other activities to be part of its task.
It's the only activity in the task.  If it starts another activity, that
activity is assigned to a different task — as if <code>FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK</code> was in the intent.
</p>
<p>As shown in the table above, <code>standard</code> is the default mode and is
appropriate for most types of activities. <code>SingleTop</code> is also a
common and useful launch mode for many types of activities. The other modes
— <code>singleTask</code> and <code>singleInstance</code> — are
<span style="color:red">not appropriate for most applications</span>,
since they result in an interaction model that is likely to be unfamiliar to
users and is very different from most other applications.

</p>
<p>Regardless of the launch mode that you choose, make sure to test the usability
of the activity during launch and when navigating back to it from
other activities and tasks using the <em>Back</em> button. </p>
<p>For more information on launch modes and their interaction with Intent
flags, see the
<a href="/guide/components/tasks-and-back-stack.html">Tasks and Back Stack</a>
document.
</p>
<p>
Normally, a new instance of an activity is launched into the process of the
application that defined it, so all instances of the activity run in the same
process.  However, if this flag is set to "<code>true</code>", instances of the
activity can run in multiple processes, allowing the system to create instances
wherever they are used (provided permissions allow it), something that is almost
never necessary or desirable.
</p>
<p>Once you publish your application, you <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/06/things-that-cannot-change.html">should not
change this name</a> (unless you've set <code><a href="#exported">android:exported</a>="false"</code>).</p>
<p>
There is no default.  The name must be specified.
</p>
<p>
A value of "<code>true</code>" means that the activity will not leave a
historical trace.  It will not remain in the activity stack for the task,
so the user will not be able to return to it.
</p>
<p>
This attribute was introduced in API Level 3.
</p>
<p>The system reads this attribute to determine which activity should be started when
  the user presses the Up button in the action bar. The system can also use this information to
  synthesize a back stack of activities with <code><a href="/reference/android/app/TaskStackBuilder.html">TaskStackBuilder</a></code>.</p>
<p>To support API levels 4 - 16, you can also declare the parent activity with a <code>&lt;meta-data&gt;</code> element that specifies a value for <code>"android.support.PARENT_ACTIVITY"</code>.
For example:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 108e47ed-7553-4e56-9b3e-70acad376b78</p>
<pre>
&lt;activity
    android:name="com.example.app.ChildActivity"
    android:label="@string/title_child_activity"
    android:parentActivityName="com.example.myfirstapp.MainActivity" &gt;
    &lt;!-- Parent activity meta-data to support API level 4+ --&gt;
    &lt;meta-data
        android:name="android.support.PARENT_ACTIVITY"
        android:value="com.example.app.MainActivity" /&gt;
&lt;/activity&gt;
</pre>
<p>For more information about declaring the parent activity to support Up navigation,
read <a href="/training/implementing-navigation/ancestral.html">Providing Up
Navigation</a>.</p>
<p>
This attribute was introduced in API Level 16.
</p>
<p>
If this attribute is not set, the permission set by the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code>
element's
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#prmsn">permission</a></code>
attribute applies to the activity.  If neither attribute is set, the activity is
not protected by a permission.
</p>
<p>
For more information on permissions, see the
<a href="/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html#sectperm">Permissions</a>
section in the introduction and another document,
<a href="/guide/topics/security/security.html">Security and
Permissions</a>.
</p>
<p>
If the name assigned to this attribute begins with a colon (':'), a new
process, private to the application, is created when it's needed and
the activity runs in that process.
If the process name begins with a lowercase character, the activity will run
in a global process of that name, provided that it has permission to do so.
This allows components in different applications to share a process, reducing
resource usage.
</p>
<p>The <code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code> element's
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#proc">process</a></code>
attribute can set a different default process name for all components.
</p>
<p>This attribute set to "<code>true</code>" also permits the activity's use of the
<code><a href="/reference/android/app/ActivityManager.TaskDescription.html">ActivityManager.TaskDescription</a></code> to change labels, colors
and icons in the <a href="/guide/components/recents.html">overview screen</a>.</p>
<p>The value can be any one of the following strings:</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When you declare one of the landscape or portrait values,
it is considered a hard requirement for the orientation in which the activity runs. As such,
the value you declare enables filtering by services such as Google Play so your application is
available only to devices that support the orientation required by your activities. For
example, if you declare either <code>"landscape"</code>, <code>"reverseLandscape"</code>, or
<code>"sensorLandscape"</code>, then your application will be available only to devices that support
landscape orientation. However, you should also explicitly declare that
your application requires either portrait or landscape orientation with the <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/uses-feature-element.html"><code>&lt;uses-feature&gt;</code></a>
element. For example, <code>&lt;uses-feature
android:name="android.hardware.screen.portrait"/&gt;</code>. This is purely a filtering behavior
provided by Google Play (and other services that support it) and the platform itself does not
control whether your app can be installed when a device supports only certain orientations.</p>
<p>
Normally, before an activity is temporarily shut down to save resources, its
<code><code><a href="/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onSaveInstanceState(android.os.Bundle)">onSaveInstanceState()</a></code></code>
method is called.  This method stores the current state of the activity in a
<code><a href="/reference/android/os/Bundle.html">Bundle</a></code> object, which is then passed to
<code><code><a href="/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onCreate(android.os.Bundle)">onCreate()</a></code></code> when the activity
is restarted.  If this attribute is set to "<code>true</code>",
<code>onSaveInstanceState()</code> may not be called and <code>onCreate()</code> will
be passed <code>null</code> instead of the Bundle — just as it was when the
activity started for the first time.
</p>
<p>
A "<code>true</code>" setting ensures that the activity can be restarted in the
absence of retained state.  For example, the activity that displays the
home screen uses this setting to make sure that it does not get removed if it
crashes for some reason.
</p>
<p>
The affinity determines two things — the task that the activity is re-parented
to (see the <code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html#reparent">allowTaskReparenting</a></code>
attribute) and the task that will house the activity when it is launched
with the <code><code><a href="/reference/android/content/Intent.html#FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK">FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK</a></code></code>
flag.
</p>
<p>
By default, all activities in an application have the same affinity.  You
can set this attribute to group them differently, and even place
activities defined in different applications within the same task.  To
specify that the activity does not have an affinity for any task, set
it to an empty string.

</p>
<p>
If this attribute is not set, the activity inherits the affinity set
for the application (see the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code>
element's
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#aff">taskAffinity</a></code>
attribute).  The name of the default affinity for an application is
the package name set by the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element.html">&lt;manifest&gt;</a></code>
element.
</p>
<p>
If this attribute is not set, the activity inherits the theme set for the
application as a whole — from the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code>
element's
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#theme">theme</a></code>
attribute.  If that attribute is also not set, the default system theme is used. For more
information, see the <a href="/guide/topics/ui/themes.html">Styles and Themes</a> developer guide.
</p>
<p>Must be one of the following values.</p>
<p>For more information about the action bar, see the <a href="/guide/topics/ui/actionbar.html">Action Bar</a> developer guide.</p>
<p>This attribute was added in API level 14.</p>
<ul>
<li>The state of the soft keyboard — whether it is hidden or visible
— when the activity becomes the focus of user attention.</li>

<li>The adjustment made to the activity's main window — whether it is
resized smaller to make room for the soft keyboard or whether its contents
pan to make the current focus visible when part of the window is covered by
the soft keyboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The setting must be one of the values listed in the following table, or a
combination of one "<code>state...</code>" value plus one "<code>adjust...</code>"
value.  Setting multiple values in either group — multiple
"<code>state...</code>" values, for example — has undefined results.
Individual values are separated by a vertical bar (<code>|</code>).  For example:
</p>
<p>WHATSON? 61f2ba82-96f2-4846-998a-48ad0c3d80e7</p>
<pre>&lt;activity android:windowSoftInputMode="stateVisible|adjustResize" . . . &gt;</pre>
<p>
Values set here (other than "<code>stateUnspecified</code>" and
"<code>adjustUnspecified</code>") override values set in the theme.
</p>
<p>
       This is the default setting for the behavior of the soft keyboard.
       </p>
<p>
       This is the default setting for the behavior of the main window.
       </p>
<p>
This attribute was introduced in API Level 3.
