<h1>Questions and Exercises: Interfaces</h1>
<h2>Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>At the beginning of this lesson, you learned that the core collection interfaces
 are organized into two distinct
inheritance trees. One interface in particular is not considered to be 
a true <code>Collection</code>, and therefore sits at the top of its own tree. What is the name 
of this interface?
</li>

<li>
Each interface in the collections framework is declared
with the <code>&lt;E&gt;</code> syntax, which tells you that it is 
generic. When you declare a <code>Collection</code> instance, what is
the advantage of specifying the type of objects that it will contain?
</li>

<li>
What interface represents a collection that does not allow duplicate elements?
</li>

<li>
What interface forms the root of the collections hierarchy?
</li>

<li>
What interface represents an ordered collection that may contain duplicate elements?
</li>

<li>
What interface represents a collection that holds elements prior to processing?
</li>

<li>
What interface repesents a type that maps keys to values?
</li>

<li>
What interface represents a double-ended queue?
</li>

<li>Name three different ways to iterate over the elements of a <code>List</code>.</li>

<li>True or False: Aggregate operations are mutative operations that modify the underlying collection.</li>


</ol>
<h2>Exercises</h2>
<ol>
<li>Write a program that prints its arguments in random order. Do not make a copy of the argument array.
Demonstrate how to print out the elements using both streams and the traditional enhanced for statement.

</li>
<li>Take the 
<a class="SourceLink" target="_blank" href="../examples/FindDups.java" onclick="showCode('../../../displayCode.html', '../examples/FindDups.java'); return false;"><code>FindDups</code></a>example 
 and modify it to use a <code>SortedSet</code> instead of a <code>Set</code>. Specify a <code>Comparator</code> so that case is ignored when sorting and identifying set elements.</li>
<li>Write a method that takes a <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code> and applies 
<a class="APILink" target="_blank" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#trim--"><code>String.trim</code></a> to each element. 
</li>


<li>Consider the four core interfaces, <code>Set</code>, <code>List</code>, <code>Queue</code>, and <code>Map</code>.
For each of the following four assignments, specify which of the four core
interfaces is best-suited, and explain how to use it to implement the assignment.
  <ol>
    <li>Whimsical Toys Inc (WTI) needs to record the names of all its employees. Every month, an employee will be chosen at random
 from these records to receive a free toy.</li>
   <li>WTI has decided that each new product will be named after an employee but only first names will be used, and each name
 will be used only once. Prepare a list of unique first names.</li>
   <li>WTI decides that it only wants to use the most popular names for its toys. Count up the number of employees who have each first
 name.</li>
   <li>WTI acquires season tickets for the local lacrosse team, to be shared by employees. Create a waiting list for this popular
sport.</li>
  </ol>
