<h1>Developing a Java Web Start Application</h1>
<p>Software designed by using 
<a class="TutorialLink" target="_top" href="../index.html#componentBasedArch">component-based architecture</a> can easily be developed and deployed as a Java Web Start application. Consider the example of a Java Web Start application with a Swing-based graphical user interface (GUI). With component-based design, the GUI can be built with smaller building blocks or components. The following general steps are used to create an application's GUI:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a <code>MyTopJPanel</code> class that is a subclass of <code>JPanel</code>. Lay out your application's GUI components in the constructor of the <code>MyTopJPanel</code> class.</li>
<li>Create a class called <code>MyApplication</code> that is a subclass of the <code>JFrame</code> class.</li>
<li>In the <code>main</code> method of the <code>MyApplication</code> class, instantiate the <code>MyTopJPanel</code> class and set it as the content pane of the <code>JFrame</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following sections explore these steps in greater detail by using the Dynamic Tree Demo application. If you are not familiar with Swing, see

<h2>Creating the Top <code>JPanel</code> Class</h2>
<p>Create a class that is a subclass of <code>JPanel</code>. This top <code>JPanel</code> acts as a container for all your other UI components. In the following example, the <code>DynamicTreePanel</code> class is the topmost <code>JPanel</code>. The constructor of the <code>DynamicTreePanel</code> class invokes other methods to create and lay out the UI controls properly.</p>

public class DynamicTreePanel extends JPanel implements ActionListener {
    private int newNodeSuffix = 1;
    private static String ADD_COMMAND = "add";
    private static String REMOVE_COMMAND = "remove";
    private static String CLEAR_COMMAND = "clear";
    
    private DynamicTree treePanel;

    public DynamicTreePanel() {
        super(new BorderLayout());
        
        //Create the components.
        treePanel = new DynamicTree();
        populateTree(treePanel);

        JButton addButton = new JButton("Add");
        addButton.setActionCommand(ADD_COMMAND);
        addButton.addActionListener(this);
        
        JButton removeButton = new JButton("Remove");
        ....
        
        JButton clearButton = new JButton("Clear");
        ...
        
        //Lay everything out.
        treePanel.setPreferredSize(
            new Dimension(300, 150));
        add(treePanel, BorderLayout.CENTER);

        JPanel panel = new JPanel(new GridLayout(0,3));
        panel.add(addButton);
        panel.add(removeButton); 
        panel.add(clearButton);
        add(panel, BorderLayout.SOUTH);
    }
    // ...
}
</pre>
<h2>Creating the Application</h2>
<p>For an application that has a Swing-based GUI, create a class that is a subclass of <code>javax.swing.JFrame</code>.</p>
<p>Instantiate your top <code>JPanel</code> class and set it as the content pane of the <code>JFrame</code> in the application's <code>main</code> method. The <code>main</code> method of the <code>DynamicTreeApplication</code> class invokes the <code>createGUI</code> method in the AWT Event Dispatcher thread.</p>
<p>WHATSON? 6720ab82-dc25-4ffd-a748-40156e8558bd</p>
<pre>
package webstartComponentArch;

import javax.swing.JFrame;

public class DynamicTreeApplication extends JFrame {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        DynamicTreeApplication app = new DynamicTreeApplication();
        app.createGUI();
    }

    private void createGUI() {
        //Create and set up the content pane.
        DynamicTreePanel newContentPane = new DynamicTreePanel();
        newContentPane.setOpaque(true); 
        setContentPane(newContentPane);
        setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        pack();
        setVisible(true);
    }    
}
</pre>
<h2>Benefits of Separating Core Functionality From the Final Deployment Mechanism</h2>
<p>Another way to create an application is to just remove the layer of abstraction (separate top <code>JPanel</code>) and lay out all the controls in the application's <code>main</code> method itself. The downside to creating the GUI directly in the application's <code>main</code> method is that it will be more difficult to deploy your functionality as an applet, if you choose to do so later.</p>
<p>In the Dynamic Tree Demo example, the core functionality is separated into the <code>DynamicTreePanel</code> class. It is now trivial to drop the <code>DynamicTreePanel</code> class into a <code>JApplet</code> and deploy it as an applet.</p>
<p>Hence, to preserve portability and keep deployment options open, follow component-based design as described in this topic.</p>
