<h1>Writing Diagnostics to Standard Output and Error Streams</h1>
<p>A Java applet can write messages to the standard output and standard error streams. Writing diagnostics to standard output can be an invaluable tool when you are debugging a Java applet.</p>
<p>The following code snippet writes messages to the standard output stream and the standard error stream.</p>

<pre>
<em>// Where instance variables are declared:</em>
boolean DEBUG = true;
// ...
<em>// Later, when we want to print some status:</em>
if (DEBUG) {
    try {
        // ...
        //some code that throws an exception
        System.out.
            println("Called someMethod(" + x + "," + y + ")");
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace()
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Check the Java Console log for messages written to the standard output stream or standard error stream. To store messages in a log file, enable logging in the Java Control Panel. Messages will be written to a log file in the user's home directory (for example, on Windows, the log file might be in <code>C:\Documents and Settings\someuser\Application Data\Sun\Java\Deployment\log</code>).</p>
