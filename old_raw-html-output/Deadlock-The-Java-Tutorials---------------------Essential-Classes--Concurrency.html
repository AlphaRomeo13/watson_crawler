<h1>Deadlock</h1>
<p><i>Deadlock</i> describes a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other. Here's an example.</p>
<p>Alphonse and Gaston are friends, and great believers in courtesy. A strict rule of courtesy is that when you bow to a friend, you must remain bowed until your friend has a chance to return the bow. Unfortunately, this rule does not account for the possibility that two friends might bow to each other at the same time. This example application, 
<a class="SourceLink" target="_blank" href="examples/Deadlock.java" onclick="showCode('../../displayCode.html', 'examples/Deadlock.java'); return false;"><code><code>Deadlock</code></code></a>, models this possibility:</p>

        public Friend(String name) {

        public synchronized void bow(Friend bower) {
            System.out.format("%s: %s"
                + "  has bowed to me!%n",

            bower.bowBack(this);
        }
        public synchronized void bowBack(Friend bower) {
            System.out.format("%s: %s"
                + " has bowed back to me!%n",
                this.name, bower.getName());
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final Friend alphonse =
            new Friend("Alphonse");
        final Friend gaston =
            new Friend("Gaston");
        new Thread(new Runnable() {
            public void run() { alphonse.bow(gaston); }
        }).start();
        new Thread(new Runnable() {
            public void run() { gaston.bow(alphonse); }
        }).start();
    }
}

<p>When <code>Deadlock</code> runs, it's extremely likely that both threads will block when they attempt to invoke <code>bowBack</code>. Neither block will ever end, because each thread is waiting for the other to exit <code>bow</code>.</p>
