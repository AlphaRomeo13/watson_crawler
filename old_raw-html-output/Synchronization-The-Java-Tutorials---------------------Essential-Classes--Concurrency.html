<h1>Synchronization</h1>
<p>Threads communicate primarily by sharing access to fields and the objects reference fields refer to. This form of communication is extremely efficient, but makes two kinds of errors possible: <i>thread interference</i> and <i>memory consistency errors</i>. The tool needed to prevent these errors is <i>synchronization</i>.</p>
<p>However, synchronization can introduce <a name="thread_contention"><em>thread contention</em></a>, which occurs when two or more threads try to access the same resource simultaneously <em>and</em> cause the Java runtime to execute one or more threads more slowly, or even suspend their execution.
<a class="TutorialLink" target="_top" href="../../essential/concurrency/starvelive.html">Starvation and livelock</a> are forms of thread contention. See the section
<a class="TutorialLink" target="_top" href="../../essential/concurrency/liveness.html">Liveness</a> for more information.</p>
<p>This section covers the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="interfere.html">Thread Interference</a> describes how errors are introduced when multiple threads access shared data.</li>
<li><a href="memconsist.html">Memory Consistency Errors</a> describes errors that result from inconsistent views of shared memory.</li>
<li><a href="syncmeth.html">Synchronized Methods</a> describes a simple idiom that can effectively prevent thread interference and memory consistency errors.</li>
<li><a href="locksync.html">Implicit Locks and Synchronization</a> describes a more general synchronization idiom, and describes how synchronization is based on implicit locks.</li>
<li><a href="atomic.html">Atomic Access</a> talks about the general idea of operations that can't be interfered with by other threads.</li>
</ul>
