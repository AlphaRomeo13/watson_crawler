<h1>File I/O (Featuring NIO.2)</h1>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This tutorial reflects the file I/O mechanism introduced in the JDK 7 release. The Java SE 6 version of the File I/O tutorial was brief, but you can download the 
Java SE Tutorial 2008-03-14 version of the tutorial which contains the earlier File I/O content.</p>
<p>The <code>java.nio.file</code> package and its related package, <code>java.nio.file.attribute</code>, provide comprehensive support for file I/O and for accessing the default file system. Though the API has many classes, you need to focus on only a few entry points. You will see that this API is very intuitive and easy to use.</p>
<p>The tutorial starts by asking 
what is a path? Then, the 
Path class, the primary entry point for the package, is introduced. Methods in the <code>Path</code> class relating to 
syntactic operations are explained. The tutorial then moves on to the other primary class in the package, the <code>Files</code> class, which contains methods that deal with file operations. First, some concepts common to many 
file operations are introduced. The tutorial then covers methods for 
checking, 
deleting, 
copying, and 
moving files.</p>
<p>The tutorial shows how 
metadata is managed, before moving on to 
file I/O and 
directory I/O. 
Random access files are explained and issues specific to 
symbolic and hard links are examined.</p>
<p>Next, some of the very powerful, but more advanced, topics are covered. First, the capability to 
recursively walk the file tree is demonstrated, followed by information about how to 
search for files using wild cards. Next, how to 
watch a directory for changes is explained and demonstrated. Then, 
methods that didn't fit elsewhere are given some attention.</p>
<p>Finally, if you have file I/O code written prior to the Java SE 7 release, there is a 
map from the old API to the new API, as well as important information about the <code>File.toPath</code> method for developers who would like to 
leverage the new API without rewriting existing code.</p>
