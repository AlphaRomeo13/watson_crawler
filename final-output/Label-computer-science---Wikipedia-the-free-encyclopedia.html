<h1>Label (computer science)</h1>
<p>A <b>label</b> in a programming language is a sequence of characters that identifies a location within source code. In most languages labels take the form of an identifier, often followed by a punctuation character (e.g., a colon). In many high level programming languages the purpose of a label is to act as the destination of a <code>GOTO</code> statement. In assembly language labels can be used anywhere an address can (for example, as the operand of a <code>JMP</code> or <code>MOV</code> instruction). Also in Pascal and its derived variations. Some languages, such as Fortran and BASIC, support numeric labels. Labels are also used to identify an entry point into a compiled sequence of statements (e.g., during debugging).</p>
