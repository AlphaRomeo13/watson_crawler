<h2>Client–server programming</h2>
<h2>Socket programming</h2>
<p>The endpoint in an interprocess communication is called a socket, or a network socket for disambiguation. Since most communication between computers is based on the Internet Protocol, an almost equivalent term is <i>Internet socket</i>. The data transmission between two sockets is organised by communications protocols, usually implemented in the operating system of the participating computers. Application programs write to and read from these sockets. Therefore, network programming is essentially socket programming.</p>
