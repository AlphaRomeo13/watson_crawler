<h1>Object slicing</h1>
<p>In object-oriented programming, a subclass typically extends its superclass by defining additional member variables. If a superclass instance is assigned its value from a subclass instance, member variables defined in the subclass cannot be copied, since the superclass has no place to store them. This is a natural and unavoidable consequence of assignment by value from subclass objects. The term <i>object slicing</i> is sometimes used to refer to this aspect of assignment by value to a superclass instance.</p>
<p><i>Object slicing</i> is also used to refer to a more subtle, problematic, case in which an object assignment by value appears to be to a superclass instance but is actually to a subclass instance. From the perspective of object memory layout, the member variables of the source instance can be thought of as having been "sliced off", <i>leaving the corresponding member variables in the destination instance unchanged</i>. It is this <i>partial assignment</i> (arguably a more apt term) that often surprises programmers and leads to unintended consequences.</p>
<p>Unexpected object slicing can happen in languages such as C++ in which assignment by value is not polymorphic. It is not possible in the D programming language, which allows object inheritance only through reference types.</p>

<pre>
struct A
{
    A(int a) : a_var(a) {}
    int a_var;
};
 
struct B : public A
{
    B(int a, int b) : A(a), b_var(b) {}
    int b_var;
};
 
B &amp;getB()
{
    static B b(1, 2);
    return b;
}
 
int main()
{
    // Normal assignment by value to a
    A a(3);
    a = getB();
    // a.a_var == 1, b.b_var not copied to a
 
    B b2(3, 4);
    A &amp;a2 = b2;
    // Partial assignment by value through reference to b2
    a2 = getB();
    // b2.a_var == 1, b2.b_var == 4!
 
    return 0;
}
