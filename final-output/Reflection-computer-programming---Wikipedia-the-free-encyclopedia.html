<h1>Reflection (computer programming)</h1>
<p>In computer science, <b>reflection</b> is the ability of a computer program to examine (see type introspection) and modify the structure and behavior (specifically the values, meta-data, properties and functions) of the program at runtime.</p>

<h2>Historical background</h2>
<p>The earliest computers were programmed in their native assembly language, which were inherently reflective as these original architectures could be programmed by defining instructions as data and using self-modifying code. As programming moved to higher level languages such as C, this reflective ability disappeared (outside of malware) until programming languages with reflection built into their type systems appeared.</p>
<p>Brian Cantwell Smith's 1982 doctoral dissertation introduced the notion of computational reflection in programming languages, and the notion of the meta-circular interpreter as a component of 3-Lisp.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>Reflection can be used for observing and/or modifying program execution at runtime. A reflection-oriented program component can monitor the execution of an enclosure of code and can modify itself according to a desired goal related to that enclosure. This is typically accomplished by dynamically assigning program code at runtime.</p>
<p>In object oriented programming languages such as Java, reflection allows <i>inspection</i> of classes, interfaces, fields and methods at runtime without knowing the names of the interfaces, fields, methods at compile time. It also allows <i>instantiation</i> of new objects and <i>invocation</i> of methods.</p>
<p>Reflection can also be used to adapt a given program to different situations dynamically. For example, consider an application that uses two different classes <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> interchangeably to perform similar operations. Without reflection-oriented programming, the application might be hard-coded to call method names of class <code>X</code> and class <code>Y</code>. However, using the reflection-oriented programming paradigm, the application could be designed and written to utilize reflection in order to invoke methods in classes <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> without hard-coding method names. Reflection-oriented programming almost always requires additional knowledge, framework, relational mapping, and object relevance in order to take advantage of more generic code execution. Hard-coding can be avoided to the extent that reflection-oriented programming is used.</p>
<p>Reflection is often used as part of software testing, such as for the runtime creation/instantiation of mock objects.</p>
<p>Reflection is also a key strategy for metaprogramming.</p>
<p>In some object-oriented programming languages, such as C# and Java, reflection can be used to override member accessibility rules. For example, reflection makes it possible to change the value of a field marked "private" in a third-party library's class.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>A language supporting reflection provides a number of features available at runtime that would otherwise be very obscure to accomplish in a lower-level language. Some of these features are the abilities to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discover and modify source code constructions (such as code blocks, classes, methods, protocols, etc.) as a first-class object at runtime.</li>
<li>Convert a string matching the symbolic name of a class or function into a reference to or invocation of that class or function.</li>
<li>Evaluate a string as if it were a source code statement at runtime.</li>
<li>Create a new interpreter for the language's bytecode to give a new meaning or purpose for a programming construct.</li>
</ul>
<p>These features can be implemented in different ways. In MOO, reflection forms a natural part of everyday programming idiom. When verbs (methods) are called, various variables such as <i>verb</i> (the name of the verb being called) and <i>this</i> (the object on which the verb is called) are populated to give the context of the call. Security is typically managed by accessing the caller stack programmatically: Since <i>callers()</i> is a list of the methods by which the current verb was eventually called, performing tests on callers()[1] (the command invoked by the original user) allows the verb to protect itself against unauthorised use.</p>
<p>Compiled languages rely on their runtime system to provide information about the source code. A compiled Objective-C executable, for example, records the names of all methods in a block of the executable, providing a table to correspond these with the underlying methods (or selectors for these methods) compiled into the program. In a compiled language that supports runtime creation of functions, such as Common Lisp, the runtime environment must include a compiler or an interpreter.</p>
<p>Reflection can be implemented for languages not having built-in reflection facilities by using a program transformation system to define automated source code changes.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>The following code snippets create an instance <code>foo</code> of class <code>Foo</code>, and invoke its method <code>hello</code>. For each programming language, normal and reflection-based call sequences are shown.</p>
<h3>ECMAScript</h3>
<p>The following is an example in ECMAScript, and therefore also applies to JavaScript and ActionScript:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 048e4e7f-8469-49bb-b642-2f82b82f9ae6</p>
<pre>
// Without reflection
new Foo().hello()
 
// With reflection
 
// assuming that Foo resides in this
new this['Foo']()['hello']()
 
// or without assumption
new (eval('Foo'))()['hello']()
 
// or simply
eval('new Foo().hello()')
</pre>
<h3>PHP</h3>
<p>The following is an example in PHP:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 89016d88-b64d-45d4-a988-e7ea415c5559</p>
<pre>
// without reflection
$foo = new Foo();
$foo-&gt;hello();
 
// with reflection
$reflector = new ReflectionClass('Foo');
$foo = $reflector-&gt;newInstance();
$hello = $reflector-&gt;getMethod('hello');
$hello-&gt;invoke($foo);
 
// using callback
$foo = new Foo();
call_user_func(array($foo, 'hello'));
 
// using variable variables syntax
$className = 'Foo';
$foo = new $className();
$method = 'hello';
$foo-&gt;$method();
</pre>

<pre>
// Foo class.
@interface Foo : NSObject
- (void)hello;
@end
 
// Sending "hello" to a Foo instance without reflection.
Foo *obj = [[Foo alloc] init];
[obj hello];
 
// Sending "hello" to a Foo instance with reflection.
id obj = [[NSClassFromString(@"Foo") alloc] init];
[obj performSelector: @selector(hello)];
</pre>

obj &lt;- foo()
hello(obj)
