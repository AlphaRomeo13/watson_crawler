<h1>Checking a File or Directory</h1>
<p>You have a <code>Path</code> instance representing a file or directory, but does that file exist on the file system? Is it readable? Writable? Executable?</p>
<h2>Verifying the Existence of a File or Directory</h2>
<p>The methods in the <code>Path</code> class are syntactic, meaning that they operate on the <code>Path</code> instance. But eventually you must access the file system to verify that a particular <code>Path</code> exists, or does not exist. You can do so with the 
<code>exists(Path, LinkOption...)</code> and the 
<code>notExists(Path, LinkOption...)</code> methods. Note that <code>!Files.exists(path)</code> is not equivalent to <code>Files.notExists(path)</code>. When you are testing a file's existence, three results are possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>The file is verified to exist.</li>
<li>The file is verified to not exist.</li>
<li>The file's status is unknown. This result can occur when the program does not have access to the file.</li>
</ul>
<p>If both <code>exists</code> and <code>notExists</code> return <code>false</code>, the existence of the file cannot be verified.</p>
<h2>Checking File Accessibility</h2>
<p>To verify that the program can access a file as needed, you can use the 
<code>isReadable(Path)</code>, 
<code>isWritable(Path)</code>, and 
<code>isExecutable(Path)</code> methods.</p>
<p>The following code snippet verifies that a particular file exists and that the program has the ability to execute the file.</p>
<p>WHATSON? b08902b9-0b53-4c8d-bf3e-2e52c08b8ead</p>
<pre>
Path file = ...;
boolean isRegularExecutableFile = Files.isRegularFile(file) &amp;
         Files.isReadable(file) &amp; Files.isExecutable(file);
</pre>
<h2>Checking Whether Two Paths Locate the Same File</h2>
<p>When you have a file system that uses symbolic links, it is possible to have two different paths that locate the same file. The 
<code>isSameFile(Path, Path)</code> method compares two paths to determine if they locate the same file on the file system. For example:</p>
<p>WHATSON? eca5461b-1820-4bd9-8464-c7cab4beb342</p>
<pre>
Path p1 = ...;
Path p2 = ...;

if (Files.isSameFile(p1, p2)) {
    // Logic when the paths locate the same file
}
</pre>
