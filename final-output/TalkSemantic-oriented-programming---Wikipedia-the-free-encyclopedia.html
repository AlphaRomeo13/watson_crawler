<p>How does this relate to knowledge-based programming? 66.91.255.120 (talk) 13:05, 21 January 2010 (UTC)</p>
<p>The current version contains the words "semantic meaning", which requires improvement. The phrase is a tautology: semantic = having meaning, thus "semantic meaning" = "a meaning that has a meaning", and therefore serves no purpose (compare: a "circle-shaped circle"). Probably it would be better to use something like "intentional meaning"? (intention: what you want to achieve on a conceptual level as opposed to operational: how you want to achieve it) Chide Groenouwe (talk) 23:32, 3 June 2010 (UTC)</p>
<p>Semantic-oriented programming sounds as a tautology in general, given the fact that all programming languages have a semantics (languages do have a semantics by definition). Chide Groenouwe (talk) 23:32, 3 June 2010 (UTC)</p>
<p>The idea behind semantic oriented programming is that, unlike many programming languages, the focus is on semantics not syntax, and that those semantics are malleable things. The "semantic meaning" of something in programming languages is interesting, because semantics in programming languages don't follow your definition. Semantics in programming languages are the actual actions taken by the language for a specific concept. In a loose sense, yes, it is the meaning of the code. In a more formal sense it is a possible thing you can describe. For example pointer semantics are the rules that govern how pointers in a given language work. And the semantic meaning of them can change from language to language, even though the semantics for pointers remain the same (In that they have the same semantic construct, but the meaning of that construct could differ). Semantic is a domain specific word to describe the semantics of programming languages, unfortunely that means it is hard to describe the semantics of semantics, hence semantic meaning. (The domain being programming language design). 199.48.195.202 (talk) 00:24, 5 March 2012 (UTC)</p>
<h2>MAYOR REWRITE PROPOSED!!!</h2>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I'm new to Wikipedia, and this would be my first contribution. At the welcome page it has been explicitly told to be <b>bold</b>... and in that sense I would propose a mayor rewrite of this article. Particularly because I have my own interpretation of SOP, and I want to make clear what are the common grounds and what are the different approaches regarding SOP.</p>
<p>Please consider the following proposal which I was working out. There is little left from the original article, but I think it represents the matter in a more comprehensive and precise way.</p>
<p>If nobody minds/vetos I will put the revised article online in a couple of days (beginning of April). Anyway, any feedback/suggestions/improvements etc. is welcome, and we can talk about that on this discussion site.</p>
<p>regards, Chris</p>
