<h1>Finding and Loading Data Files</h1>
<p>Whenever a Java applet needs to load data from a file that is specified with a relative URL (a URL that doesn't completely specify the file's location), the applet usually uses either the code base or the document base to form the complete URL.</p>
<p>The code base, returned by the <code>JApplet</code> <code>getCodeBase</code> method, is a URL that specifies the directory from which the applet's classes were loaded. For locally deployed applets, the <code>getCodeBase</code> method returns null.</p>
<p>The document base, returned by the <code>JApplet</code> <code>getDocumentBase</code> method, specifies the directory of the HTML page that contains the applet. For locally deployed applets, the <code>getDocumentBase</code> method returns null.</p>
<p>Unless the <code>&lt;applet&gt;</code> tag specifies a code base, both the code base and document base refer to the same directory on the same server.</p>
<p>Data that the applet might need, or needs to rely on as a backup, is usually specified relative to the code base. Data that the applet developer specifies, often by using parameters, is usually specified relative to the document base.</p>
<p>The <code>JApplet</code> class defines convenient forms of image-loading and sound-loading methods that enable you to specify images and sounds relative to a base URL. For example, assume an applet is set up with one of the directory structures shown in the following figure.</p>
<p>To create an <code>Image</code> object that uses the <code>a.gif</code> image file under <code>imgDir</code>, the applet can use the following code:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 06935c91-3d8a-47b4-b9bf-6676e0326626</p>
<pre>
Image image = getImage(getCodeBase(), "imgDir/a.gif");
