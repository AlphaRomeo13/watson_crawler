<p>As users connect their televisions, home theater systems and music players with wireless
  technologies, they want to be able to play content from Android apps on these larger,
  louder devices. Enabling this kind of playback can turn your one-device, one-user app
  into a shared experience that delights and inspires multiple users.</p>
<p>The Android media router APIs are designed to enable media display and playback on these
  secondary devices. There are two main approaches you can use to play content using these
  APIs:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Remote Playback</strong>  — This approach uses the receiving device to handle
  the content data retrieval, decoding, and playback, while an Android device in the user's hand
  is used as a remote control. This approach is used by Android apps that support
  Google Cast.</li>
  <li><strong>Secondary Output</strong> — With this approach, your app retrieves, renders
  and streams video or music directly to the receiving device. This approach is used to support
  Wireless Display output
  on Android.</li>
</ul>
<p>This guide explains how your app can deliver media to secondary playback devices using either
  of these approaches.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The media router APIs enable a broad range of media output to playback equipment connected to
  Android devices through wireless and wired means. To enable these connections,
  the media router framework abstracts the logical paths for audio and video output for an Android
  device. This architecture allows your app to quickly channel media content to
  connected playback devices such as home theaters and sound systems that provide Android media
  route support.</p>
<p>In order to use this framework within your app, you must get an instance
  of the <code>MediaRouter</code> framework object and attach a <code>MediaRouter.Callback</code> object to listen for events in
  available media routes. Content channelled through a media route passes through the route's
  associated <code>MediaRouteProvider</code> (except in a few special cases,
  such as a Bluetooth output device). The following diagram provides a high-level view of the
  classes your app can use to play content with the media router framework.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Figure 1.</strong> Overview of key media router classes used by apps.
</p>
<p>Manufacturers of media playback hardware that is not supported by the media router framework
  can add support for their devices by implementing a
  <code>MediaRouteProvider</code> and distributing it as an application.
  For more information on implementing a media route provider, see the <code>MediaRouteProvider</code> reference documentation and the v7-mediarouter
  support library sample <code>&lt;sdk&gt;/extras/android/compatibility/v7/mediarouter</code>.
</p>
<h3>Media router packages</h3>
<p>The media router APIs are provided as part of the Android Support Library version 18 and
  higher, in the
  v7-mediarouter support
  library. Specifically, you should use the classes in the <code>android.support.v7.media</code>
  package for media router functions. These APIs are compatible with devices running Android 2.1
  (API level 7) and higher.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Caution:</strong> There is another set of media router APIs provided in the
  <code>android.media</code> that have been superseded by the v7-mediarouter support library.
  You <em>should not</em> use the <code>android.media</code> classes for media router functions.
</p>
<p>In order to use the <code>android.support.v7.media</code> media router classes, you must add
  the v7-mediarouter
  support library package to your app development project.  For more
  information on adding support libraries to your app development project, see
  Support Library Setup.
</p>
<h2>Cast User Interface</h2>
<p>
  Android apps that implement the media router API should include a Cast button
  as part of their user interface, to allow users to select a media route to play media on
  a secondary output device. The media router framework provides a standard interface for
  the button, which you should use to help users recognize and use the feature in your app.
  Figure 2 illustrates how the Cast button should appear in an app.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Figure 2.</strong> A Cast button shown on the right side of the action bar.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Caution:</strong> When implementing an activity that provides a media router interface
  you <em>must</em> extend either <code>ActionBarActivity</code>
  or <code>FragmentActivity</code> from the Android Support Library, even if
  your <code>android:minSdkVersion</code> is API 11 or higher.
</p>
<h3>Cast button</h3>
<p>The recommended way to implement the Cast button user interface is to extend your activity
  from <code>ActionBarActivity</code> and use the <code>onCreateOptionsMenu()</code> method to add an options menu.
  The Cast button must use the <code>MediaRouteActionProvider</code> class
  as its action:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 2a61ecd5-f5af-4a0d-bd0c-c71cf47e889f</p>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;menu xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
      xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
      &gt;

    &lt;item android:id="@+id/media_route_menu_item"
        android:title="@string/media_route_menu_title"
        <strong>app:actionProviderClass="android.support.v7.app.MediaRouteActionProvider"</strong>
        app:showAsAction="always"
    /&gt;
&lt;/menu&gt;
</pre>
<p>For more information about implementing the action bar in your app,
  see the Action Bar
  developer guide.
</p>
<p>Once you have added the Cast button to your user interface, you must attach a media
  route selector object. Building a selector is discussed in the next section.
</p>
<p>If you do not want a menu in your action bar, you can also add a Cast button to your app using
  <code>MediaRouteButton</code>. If you choose this approach, you should add
  this button to your app's action bar according to the
  Google Cast Design
  Checklist. You must also attach a media route selector to the button using the
  <code>setRouteSelector()</code> method.
</p>
<p>For guidelines on incorporating the Cast button into your application, review the
  Google Cast Design
  Checklist.</p>
<h3>Media route selector</h3>
<p>When a user presses the Cast button, the media router framework looks for available media
  routes and presents a list of choices to the user, as shown in figure 3.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Figure 3.</strong> A list of available media routes, shown after pressing the Cast button.
</p>
<p>The <em>types</em> of media routes that appear on this list—Remote Playback, Secondary
  Output or others—are defined by your app.You define these type by creating a <code>MediaRouteSelector</code>, which accepts <code>MediaControlIntent</code> objects provided by the framework and other media
  route providers created by you or other developers. The framework-provided route categories are as
  follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>CATEGORY_LIVE_AUDIO</code> — Output of audio to a secondary output device, such as a
    wireless-enabled music system.</li>
  <li><code>CATEGORY_LIVE_VIDEO</code> — Output of video to a secondary output device, such as Wireless
    Display devices.</li>
  <li><code>CATEGORY_REMOTE_PLAYBACK</code> — Play video or audio on a separate device that handles media
    retrieval, decoding, and playback, such as
    Chromecast devices.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>When creating a <code>MediaRouteSelector</code> object, use the
  <code>MediaRouteSelector.Builder</code> class to create the object and set
  the media playback categories (control categories), as shown
  in the following code sample:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 0659ce95-c9d1-4bda-b2e1-e1791d23f81f</p>
<pre>
public class MediaRouterPlaybackActivity extends ActionBarActivity {
    private MediaRouteSelector mSelector;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        // Create a route selector for the type of routes your app supports.
        <strong>mSelector = new MediaRouteSelector.Builder()
                // These are the framework-supported intents
                .addControlCategory(MediaControlIntent.CATEGORY_LIVE_AUDIO)
                .addControlCategory(MediaControlIntent.CATEGORY_LIVE_VIDEO)
                .addControlCategory(MediaControlIntent.CATEGORY_REMOTE_PLAYBACK)</strong>
                .build();
    }
}
</pre>
<p>The media router framework uses this selector object to provide an interface for selecting
  media routes that your app supports, as shown in figure 3. Once you have defined this selector,
  you attach it to the <code>MediaRouteActionProvider</code> object associated
  with the Cast menu item, as shown in the following code sample:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 3fab0a7b-649c-4dfa-833d-26feb5d1006b</p>
<pre>
@Override
public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
    super.onCreateOptionsMenu(menu);

    // Inflate the menu and configure the media router action provider.
    getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.sample_media_router_menu, menu);

    // Attach the MediaRouteSelector to the menu item
    MenuItem mediaRouteMenuItem = menu.findItem(R.id.media_route_menu_item);
    MediaRouteActionProvider mediaRouteActionProvider =
            (MediaRouteActionProvider)MenuItemCompat.getActionProvider(
            mediaRouteMenuItem);
    <strong>mediaRouteActionProvider.setRouteSelector(mSelector);</strong>

    // Return true to show the menu.
    return true;
}
</pre>
<p>Once you have made these changes to your app, you might expect the Cast button to appear in your
  activity. Alas, it does not (unless your device is already paired with a Wireless Display). In
  most cases, you must also connect with the media route framework, which is discussed in the next
  section.
</p>
<h2>Connecting to Media Routes</h2>
<p>In order to connect to a media route selected by the user, your app must obtain the <code>MediaRouter</code> framework object and then attach a <code>MediaRouter.Callback</code> object. The callback object receives messages
  from the media router framework when a route is selected, changed, or disconnected by the user.</p>
<p>To obtain an instance of the <code>MediaRouter</code> framework object,
  call <code>MediaRouter.getInstance()</code>
  from the <code>onCreate()</code> method of an activity that supports
  the media router API.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> The <code>MediaRouter</code> object is a singleton
  that is maintained by the framework. However, once your application obtains an instance of the
  object you must retain that instance until your application terminates to prevent it from being
  garbage collected.
</p>
<h3>Creating a MediaRouter callback</h3>
<p>The media router framework communicates with an app through a callback object that
  you attach to the <code>MediaRouter</code> framework object. An app
  that uses the media router framework must extend the <code>MediaRouter.Callback</code> object in order to receive messages when a
  media route is connected.</p>
<p>There are several methods in the callback that you can override to receive information about
  media router events. At minimum, your implementation of the <code>MediaRouter.Callback</code> class should override the following
  methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>onRouteSelected()</code>
    — Called when the user connects to a media router output device.</li>
  <li><code>onRouteUnselected()</code> — Called when the user disconnects from a media router output device.</li>
  <li><code>onRoutePresentationDisplayChanged()</code> — Called when the presentation display changes its
    display metrics, such as changing from 720 pixel to 1080 pixel resolution.</li>
</ul>
<p>The methods of your <code>MediaRouter.Callback</code>
  implementation are the first opportunity to determine if the connected route is a remote playback
  device, such as Chromecast, or a secondary output device, such as a Wireless Display device.
  If your app supports both device types, then your implementation should branch here, as
  shown in this sample code:</p>
<p>WHATSON? aadc507f-eedc-4338-b60a-5a059c196de3</p>
<pre>
private final MediaRouter.Callback mMediaRouterCallback =
        new MediaRouter.Callback() {

    @Override
    public void onRouteSelected(MediaRouter router, RouteInfo route) {
        Log.d(TAG, "onRouteSelected: route=" + route);

        if (route.supportsControlCategory(
            MediaControlIntent.CATEGORY_REMOTE_PLAYBACK)){
            // remote playback device
            updateRemotePlayer(route);
        } else {
            // secondary output device
            updatePresentation(route);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onRouteUnselected(MediaRouter router, RouteInfo route) {
        Log.d(TAG, "onRouteUnselected: route=" + route);

        if (route.supportsControlCategory(
            MediaControlIntent.CATEGORY_REMOTE_PLAYBACK)){
            // remote playback device
            updateRemotePlayer(route);
        } else {
            // secondary output device
            updatePresentation(route);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onRoutePresentationDisplayChanged(
            MediaRouter router, RouteInfo route) {
        Log.d(TAG, "onRoutePresentationDisplayChanged: route=" + route);

        if (route.supportsControlCategory(
            MediaControlIntent.CATEGORY_REMOTE_PLAYBACK)){
            // remote playback device
            updateRemotePlayer(route);
        } else {
            // secondary output device
            updatePresentation(route);
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>After defining your callback object for the media router, you still need to attach it to
  the main media router framework object. The next section discusses the appropriate way to attach
  your callbacks for media routes.</p>
<h3>Attaching a callback to MediaRouter</h3>
<p>Since media routes are a shared interface, your app must attach and detach your
  <code>MediaRouter.Callback</code> object as your app starts up and shuts
  down. To accomplish this, you must add and remove your app's
  callback object from the media router framework as part of your app's activity lifecycle. This
  approach allows other apps to make use of media route outputs while your app
  is in the background or not running.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> If you are writing a music playback app and want to allow music to play
  while your app is in the background, you must build a <code>Service</code> for playback
  and connect that service and it's lifecycle to the media router framework.
</p>
<p>The following code sample demonstrates how to use the lifecycle methods to appropriately
  add and remove your app's media router callback object:</p>
<p>WHATSON? c57d52d1-a45c-4132-8549-99793a97b455</p>
<pre>
public class MediaRouterPlaybackActivity extends ActionBarActivity {
    private MediaRouter mMediaRouter;
    private MediaRouteSelector mSelector;
    private Callback mMediaRouterCallback;

    // your app works with so the framework can discover them.
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        // Get the media router service.
        mMediaRouter = MediaRouter.getInstance(this);
        ...
    }

    // Add the callback on start to tell the media router what kinds of routes
    // your app works with so the framework can discover them.
    @Override
    public void onStart() {
        mMediaRouter.addCallback(mSelector, mMediaRouterCallback,
                MediaRouter.CALLBACK_FLAG_REQUEST_DISCOVERY);
        super.onStart();
    }

    // Remove the selector on stop to tell the media router that it no longer
    // needs to discover routes for your app.
    @Override
    public void onStop() {
        mMediaRouter.removeCallback(mMediaRouterCallback);
        super.onStop();
    }
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>You should add and remove the media router callback only in the <code>onStart()</code> and <code>onStop()</code>
  lifecycle methods. Do not include these calls in the <code>onResume()</code> or <code>onPause()</code> methods.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> The media route framework also provides a
  <code>MediaRouteDiscoveryFragment</code> class, which takes care of adding and
  removing the callback for an activity.
</p>
<p>Now when you run your application, you should see a Cast button appear in your activity.
  When you touch the button, a route selection dialog appears as shown
  in figure 3, allowing your user to select an available media route. Make sure you have a
  supported device available on your local network when testing this interface.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> In order for Wireless Display routes to show up in the media route
  selection dialog, users must enable this option in the Settings app. The option is under
  the <em>Display</em> category and is called <em>Cast screen</em> on Android 4.4 (KitKat) and higher
  devices and <em>Wireless Display</em> on Android 4.2.x (Jelly Bean) devices. For more information
  on enabling this feature see this
  Wireless display support page.
</p>
<h2>Remote Playback</h2>
<p>The remote playback approach sends control commands to a secondary device to initiate playback
  and to control playback that is in progress (pause, rewind, fast-forward, volume up and down).
  Using this approach, the receiving device (such as a Chromecast) is responsible for retrieving
  and rendering content.</p>
<p>When your app supports this type of media route, you must create a <code>RemotePlaybackClient</code> object using a remote playback <code>MediaRouter.RouteInfo</code> object received through your app's
  <code>MediaRouter.Callback</code> object. The following sample
  code demonstrates a controller method that creates a new remote playback client and sends it a
  video for playback:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 34686575-600a-4462-bb4c-3bb0e2f2775b</p>
<pre>
private void updateRemotePlayer(RouteInfo route) {
    // Changed route: tear down previous client
    if (mRoute != null &amp;&amp; mRemotePlaybackClient != null) {
        mRemotePlaybackClient.release();
        mRemotePlaybackClient = null;
    }

    // Save new route
    mRoute = route;

    // Attach new playback client
    mRemotePlaybackClient = new RemotePlaybackClient(this, mRoute);

    // Send file for playback
    mRemotePlaybackClient.play(Uri.parse(
            "http://archive.org/download/Sintel/sintel-2048-stereo_512kb.mp4"),
            "video/mp4", null, 0, null, new ItemActionCallback() {

            @Override
            public void onResult(Bundle data, String sessionId,
                    MediaSessionStatus sessionStatus,
                    String itemId, MediaItemStatus itemStatus) {
                logStatus("play: succeeded for item " + itemId);
            }

            @Override
            public void onError(String error, int code, Bundle data) {
                logStatus("play: failed - error:"+ code +" - "+ error);
            }
        });
    }
}
</pre>
<p>The <code>RemotePlaybackClient</code> class provides additional methods
  for managing content playback. Here are a few of the key playback methods from the <code>RemotePlaybackClient</code> class:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>play()</code> — Play a specific
    media file, specified by a <code>Uri</code>.</li>
  <li><code>pause()</code> — Pause the
    currently playing media track.</li>
  <li><code>resume()</code> — Continue
    playing the current track after a pause command.</li>
  <li><code>seek()</code> — Move to a specific
    position in the current track.</li>
  <li><code>release()</code> — Tear down the
    connection from your app to the remote playback device.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use these methods to attach actions to playback controls you provide in your
  app. Most of these methods also allow you to include a callback object so you can monitor
  the progress of the playback task or control request.</p>
<p>
  The <code>RemotePlaybackClient</code> class also supports queueing of
  multiple media items for playback and management of the media queue. For a comprehensive sample
  implementation of these features, see <code>SampleMediaRouterActivity</code> and its associated
  classes in the v7 mediarouter support library sample
  <code>&lt;sdk&gt;/extras/android/compatibility/v7/mediarouter</code>.
</p>
<p>
  For additional information on using the Google Cast API for Chromecast devices, see the
  Google Cast developer documentation.
</p>
<h2>Secondary Output</h2>
<p>The secondary output approach sends prepared media content to a connected secondary device
  for playback. Secondary devices can include televisions or wireless sound systems and can be
  attached through wireless protocols or wires, such as an HDMI cable. With this approach, your
  app is responsible for processing media content for playback (downloading, decoding,
  synchronization of audio and video tracks), while the secondary device only outputs the content
  in its final form.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> Using the secondary output display routes with the media router framework
  requires classes that are available only in Android 4.2 (API level 17) and higher, specifically the
  <code>Presentation</code> class. If you are building an app that supports both
  remote playback and secondary output devices, you must include checks that disable this code
  below the supported Android version level.
</p>
<h3>Creating a Presentation object</h3>
<p>When using a secondary output display with the media router framework, you create a <code>Presentation</code> object that contains the content you want to show on that display. The
  <code>Presentation</code> is extended from the <code>Dialog</code> class, so can
  add layouts and views to a <code>Presentation</code>.</p>
<p>You should be aware that the <code>Presentation</code> object has its own
  <code>Context</code> and
  <code>Resources</code>,
  separate from the app activity that created the object. Having a secondary
  context is required, because the content of the <code>Presentation</code> is drawn on a
  display that is separate from your app's display on the local Android device.
  Specifically, the secondary display needs a separate context because it may need to load
  resources based on its specific screen metrics.</p>
<p>The following code sample shows a minimal implementation of a
  <code>Presentation</code> object, including a <code>GLSurfaceView</code>
  object.</p>
<p>WHATSON? 96504279-9741-4d06-b910-416a13653034</p>
<pre>
public class SamplePresentation extends Presentation {
    public SamplePresentation(Context outerContext, Display display) {
        super(outerContext, display);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        // Notice that we get resources from the context of the Presentation
        Resources resources = getContext().getResources();

        // Inflate a layout.
        setContentView(R.layout.presentation_with_media_router_content);

        // Add presentation content here:
        // Set up a surface view for visual interest
        mSurfaceView = (GLSurfaceView)findViewById(R.id.surface_view);
        mSurfaceView.setRenderer(new CubeRenderer(false));
    }
}
</pre>
<h3>Creating a Presentation controller</h3>
<p>In order to display a <code>Presentation</code> object, you should write a
  controller layer that handles responses to the messages received by the <code>MediaRouter.Callback</code> object and manages the creation and
  removal of the <code>Presentation</code> object. The controller layer should also handle
  attaching presentations to a selected <code>Display</code> object, which represents the
  separate physical display device chosen by the user. The controller layer can simply be a method
  in the activity that supports a secondary display.</p>
<p>The following code sample shows a controller layer for a <code>Presentation</code>
  implemented as a single method. This method handles dismissing invalid presentations when a
  <code>Display</code> is unselected or disconnected, and creates the <code>Presentation</code> object when a display device is connected.</p>
<p>WHATSON? c555096a-8d60-4533-bc1f-1dd82c8dd680</p>
<pre>
private void updatePresentation(RouteInfo route) {
    // Get its Display if a valid route has been selected
    Display selectedDisplay = null;
    if (route != null) {
        selectedDisplay = route.getPresentationDisplay();
    }

    // Dismiss the current presentation if the display has changed or no new
    // route has been selected
    if (mPresentation != null &amp;&amp; mPresentation.getDisplay() != selectedDisplay) {
        mPresentation.dismiss();
            mPresentation = null;
    }

    // Show a new presentation if the previous one has been dismissed and a
    // route has been selected.
    if (mPresentation == null &amp;&amp; selectedDisplay != null) {
        // Initialize a new Presentation for the Display
        mPresentation = new SamplePresentation(this, selectedDisplay);
        mPresentation.setOnDismissListener(
                new DialogInterface.OnDismissListener() {
                    // Listen for presentation dismissal and then remove it
                    @Override
                    public void onDismiss(DialogInterface dialog) {
                        if (dialog == mPresentation) {
                            mPresentation = null;
                        }
                    }
                });

        // Try to show the presentation, this might fail if the display has
        // gone away in the meantime
        try {
            mPresentation.show();
        } catch (WindowManager.InvalidDisplayException ex) {
            // Couldn't show presentation - display was already removed
            mPresentation = null;
        }
    }
}

<p>As users connect their televisions, home theater systems and music players with wireless
  technologies, they want to be able to play content from Android apps on these larger,
  louder devices. Enabling this kind of playback can turn your one-device, one-user app
  into a shared experience that delights and inspires multiple users.</p>
<p>The Android media router APIs are designed to enable media display and playback on these
  secondary devices. There are two main approaches you can use to play content using these
  APIs:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Remote Playback</strong>  — This approach uses the receiving device to handle
  the content data retrieval, decoding, and playback, while an Android device in the user's hand
  is used as a remote control. This approach is used by Android apps that support
  Google Cast.</li>
  <li><strong>Secondary Output</strong> — With this approach, your app retrieves, renders
  and streams video or music directly to the receiving device. This approach is used to support
  Wireless Display output
  on Android.</li>
</ul>
<p>This guide explains how your app can deliver media to secondary playback devices using either
  of these approaches.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The media router APIs enable a broad range of media output to playback equipment connected to
  Android devices through wireless and wired means. To enable these connections,
  the media router framework abstracts the logical paths for audio and video output for an Android
  device. This architecture allows your app to quickly channel media content to
  connected playback devices such as home theaters and sound systems that provide Android media
  route support.</p>
<p>In order to use this framework within your app, you must get an instance
  of the <code>MediaRouter</code> framework object and attach a <code>MediaRouter.Callback</code> object to listen for events in
  available media routes. Content channelled through a media route passes through the route's
  associated <code>MediaRouteProvider</code> (except in a few special cases,
  such as a Bluetooth output device). The following diagram provides a high-level view of the
  classes your app can use to play content with the media router framework.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Figure 1.</strong> Overview of key media router classes used by apps.
</p>
<p>Manufacturers of media playback hardware that is not supported by the media router framework
  can add support for their devices by implementing a
  <code>MediaRouteProvider</code> and distributing it as an application.
  For more information on implementing a media route provider, see the <code>MediaRouteProvider</code> reference documentation and the v7-mediarouter
  support library sample <code>&lt;sdk&gt;/extras/android/compatibility/v7/mediarouter</code>.
</p>
<h3>Media router packages</h3>
<p>The media router APIs are provided as part of the Android Support Library version 18 and
  higher, in the
  v7-mediarouter support
  library. Specifically, you should use the classes in the <code>android.support.v7.media</code>
  package for media router functions. These APIs are compatible with devices running Android 2.1
  (API level 7) and higher.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Caution:</strong> There is another set of media router APIs provided in the
  <code>android.media</code> that have been superseded by the v7-mediarouter support library.
  You <em>should not</em> use the <code>android.media</code> classes for media router functions.
</p>
<p>In order to use the <code>android.support.v7.media</code> media router classes, you must add
  the v7-mediarouter
  support library package to your app development project.  For more
  information on adding support libraries to your app development project, see
  Support Library Setup.
</p>
<h2>Cast User Interface</h2>
<p>
  Android apps that implement the media router API should include a Cast button
  as part of their user interface, to allow users to select a media route to play media on
  a secondary output device. The media router framework provides a standard interface for
  the button, which you should use to help users recognize and use the feature in your app.
  Figure 2 illustrates how the Cast button should appear in an app.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Figure 2.</strong> A Cast button shown on the right side of the action bar.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Caution:</strong> When implementing an activity that provides a media router interface
  you <em>must</em> extend either <code>ActionBarActivity</code>
  or <code>FragmentActivity</code> from the Android Support Library, even if
  your <code>android:minSdkVersion</code> is API 11 or higher.
</p>
<h3>Cast button</h3>
<p>The recommended way to implement the Cast button user interface is to extend your activity
  from <code>ActionBarActivity</code> and use the <code>onCreateOptionsMenu()</code> method to add an options menu.
  The Cast button must use the <code>MediaRouteActionProvider</code> class
  as its action:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 144bd482-8f25-403c-bbfa-fb487a0d5b68</p>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;menu xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
      xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
      &gt;

    &lt;item android:id="@+id/media_route_menu_item"
        android:title="@string/media_route_menu_title"
        <strong>app:actionProviderClass="android.support.v7.app.MediaRouteActionProvider"</strong>
        app:showAsAction="always"
    /&gt;
&lt;/menu&gt;
</pre>
<p>For more information about implementing the action bar in your app,
  see the Action Bar
  developer guide.
</p>
<p>Once you have added the Cast button to your user interface, you must attach a media
  route selector object. Building a selector is discussed in the next section.
</p>
<p>If you do not want a menu in your action bar, you can also add a Cast button to your app using
  <code>MediaRouteButton</code>. If you choose this approach, you should add
  this button to your app's action bar according to the
  Google Cast Design
  Checklist. You must also attach a media route selector to the button using the
  <code>setRouteSelector()</code> method.
</p>
<p>For guidelines on incorporating the Cast button into your application, review the
  Google Cast Design
  Checklist.</p>
<h3>Media route selector</h3>
<p>When a user presses the Cast button, the media router framework looks for available media
  routes and presents a list of choices to the user, as shown in figure 3.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Figure 3.</strong> A list of available media routes, shown after pressing the Cast button.
</p>
<p>The <em>types</em> of media routes that appear on this list—Remote Playback, Secondary
  Output or others—are defined by your app.You define these type by creating a <code>MediaRouteSelector</code>, which accepts <code>MediaControlIntent</code> objects provided by the framework and other media
  route providers created by you or other developers. The framework-provided route categories are as
  follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>CATEGORY_LIVE_AUDIO</code> — Output of audio to a secondary output device, such as a
    wireless-enabled music system.</li>
  <li><code>CATEGORY_LIVE_VIDEO</code> — Output of video to a secondary output device, such as Wireless
    Display devices.</li>
  <li><code>CATEGORY_REMOTE_PLAYBACK</code> — Play video or audio on a separate device that handles media
    retrieval, decoding, and playback, such as
    Chromecast devices.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>When creating a <code>MediaRouteSelector</code> object, use the
  <code>MediaRouteSelector.Builder</code> class to create the object and set
  the media playback categories (control categories), as shown
  in the following code sample:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 02404e78-bbb1-4c1c-b191-34e78320d219</p>
<pre>
public class MediaRouterPlaybackActivity extends ActionBarActivity {
    private MediaRouteSelector mSelector;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        // Create a route selector for the type of routes your app supports.
        <strong>mSelector = new MediaRouteSelector.Builder()
                // These are the framework-supported intents
                .addControlCategory(MediaControlIntent.CATEGORY_LIVE_AUDIO)
                .addControlCategory(MediaControlIntent.CATEGORY_LIVE_VIDEO)
                .addControlCategory(MediaControlIntent.CATEGORY_REMOTE_PLAYBACK)</strong>
                .build();
    }
}
</pre>
<p>The media router framework uses this selector object to provide an interface for selecting
  media routes that your app supports, as shown in figure 3. Once you have defined this selector,
  you attach it to the <code>MediaRouteActionProvider</code> object associated
  with the Cast menu item, as shown in the following code sample:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 1f454607-4947-4ed3-aff7-ecc867518598</p>
<pre>
@Override
public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
    super.onCreateOptionsMenu(menu);

    // Inflate the menu and configure the media router action provider.
    getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.sample_media_router_menu, menu);

    // Attach the MediaRouteSelector to the menu item
    MenuItem mediaRouteMenuItem = menu.findItem(R.id.media_route_menu_item);
    MediaRouteActionProvider mediaRouteActionProvider =
            (MediaRouteActionProvider)MenuItemCompat.getActionProvider(
            mediaRouteMenuItem);
    <strong>mediaRouteActionProvider.setRouteSelector(mSelector);</strong>

    // Return true to show the menu.
    return true;
}
</pre>
<p>Once you have made these changes to your app, you might expect the Cast button to appear in your
  activity. Alas, it does not (unless your device is already paired with a Wireless Display). In
  most cases, you must also connect with the media route framework, which is discussed in the next
  section.
</p>
<h2>Connecting to Media Routes</h2>
<p>In order to connect to a media route selected by the user, your app must obtain the <code>MediaRouter</code> framework object and then attach a <code>MediaRouter.Callback</code> object. The callback object receives messages
  from the media router framework when a route is selected, changed, or disconnected by the user.</p>
<p>To obtain an instance of the <code>MediaRouter</code> framework object,
  call <code>MediaRouter.getInstance()</code>
  from the <code>onCreate()</code> method of an activity that supports
  the media router API.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> The <code>MediaRouter</code> object is a singleton
  that is maintained by the framework. However, once your application obtains an instance of the
  object you must retain that instance until your application terminates to prevent it from being
  garbage collected.
</p>
<h3>Creating a MediaRouter callback</h3>
<p>The media router framework communicates with an app through a callback object that
  you attach to the <code>MediaRouter</code> framework object. An app
  that uses the media router framework must extend the <code>MediaRouter.Callback</code> object in order to receive messages when a
  media route is connected.</p>
<p>There are several methods in the callback that you can override to receive information about
  media router events. At minimum, your implementation of the <code>MediaRouter.Callback</code> class should override the following
  methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>onRouteSelected()</code>
    — Called when the user connects to a media router output device.</li>
  <li><code>onRouteUnselected()</code> — Called when the user disconnects from a media router output device.</li>
  <li><code>onRoutePresentationDisplayChanged()</code> — Called when the presentation display changes its
    display metrics, such as changing from 720 pixel to 1080 pixel resolution.</li>
</ul>
<p>The methods of your <code>MediaRouter.Callback</code>
  implementation are the first opportunity to determine if the connected route is a remote playback
  device, such as Chromecast, or a secondary output device, such as a Wireless Display device.
  If your app supports both device types, then your implementation should branch here, as
  shown in this sample code:</p>
<p>WHATSON? eedc8a18-0e5c-496b-921d-6b6de786915e</p>
<pre>
private final MediaRouter.Callback mMediaRouterCallback =
        new MediaRouter.Callback() {

    @Override
    public void onRouteSelected(MediaRouter router, RouteInfo route) {
        Log.d(TAG, "onRouteSelected: route=" + route);

        if (route.supportsControlCategory(
            MediaControlIntent.CATEGORY_REMOTE_PLAYBACK)){
            // remote playback device
            updateRemotePlayer(route);
        } else {
            // secondary output device
            updatePresentation(route);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onRouteUnselected(MediaRouter router, RouteInfo route) {
        Log.d(TAG, "onRouteUnselected: route=" + route);

        if (route.supportsControlCategory(
            MediaControlIntent.CATEGORY_REMOTE_PLAYBACK)){
            // remote playback device
            updateRemotePlayer(route);
        } else {
            // secondary output device
            updatePresentation(route);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onRoutePresentationDisplayChanged(
            MediaRouter router, RouteInfo route) {
        Log.d(TAG, "onRoutePresentationDisplayChanged: route=" + route);

        if (route.supportsControlCategory(
            MediaControlIntent.CATEGORY_REMOTE_PLAYBACK)){
            // remote playback device
            updateRemotePlayer(route);
        } else {
            // secondary output device
            updatePresentation(route);
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>After defining your callback object for the media router, you still need to attach it to
  the main media router framework object. The next section discusses the appropriate way to attach
  your callbacks for media routes.</p>
<h3>Attaching a callback to MediaRouter</h3>
<p>Since media routes are a shared interface, your app must attach and detach your
  <code>MediaRouter.Callback</code> object as your app starts up and shuts
  down. To accomplish this, you must add and remove your app's
  callback object from the media router framework as part of your app's activity lifecycle. This
  approach allows other apps to make use of media route outputs while your app
  is in the background or not running.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> If you are writing a music playback app and want to allow music to play
  while your app is in the background, you must build a <code>Service</code> for playback
  and connect that service and it's lifecycle to the media router framework.
</p>
<p>The following code sample demonstrates how to use the lifecycle methods to appropriately
  add and remove your app's media router callback object:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 336a66bc-571b-41b2-ad20-a60d0133b967</p>
<pre>
public class MediaRouterPlaybackActivity extends ActionBarActivity {
    private MediaRouter mMediaRouter;
    private MediaRouteSelector mSelector;
    private Callback mMediaRouterCallback;

    // your app works with so the framework can discover them.
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        // Get the media router service.
        mMediaRouter = MediaRouter.getInstance(this);
        ...
    }

    // Add the callback on start to tell the media router what kinds of routes
    // your app works with so the framework can discover them.
    @Override
    public void onStart() {
        mMediaRouter.addCallback(mSelector, mMediaRouterCallback,
                MediaRouter.CALLBACK_FLAG_REQUEST_DISCOVERY);
        super.onStart();
    }

    // Remove the selector on stop to tell the media router that it no longer
    // needs to discover routes for your app.
    @Override
    public void onStop() {
        mMediaRouter.removeCallback(mMediaRouterCallback);
        super.onStop();
    }
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>You should add and remove the media router callback only in the <code>onStart()</code> and <code>onStop()</code>
  lifecycle methods. Do not include these calls in the <code>onResume()</code> or <code>onPause()</code> methods.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> The media route framework also provides a
  <code>MediaRouteDiscoveryFragment</code> class, which takes care of adding and
  removing the callback for an activity.
</p>
<p>Now when you run your application, you should see a Cast button appear in your activity.
  When you touch the button, a route selection dialog appears as shown
  in figure 3, allowing your user to select an available media route. Make sure you have a
  supported device available on your local network when testing this interface.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> In order for Wireless Display routes to show up in the media route
  selection dialog, users must enable this option in the Settings app. The option is under
  the <em>Display</em> category and is called <em>Cast screen</em> on Android 4.4 (KitKat) and higher
  devices and <em>Wireless Display</em> on Android 4.2.x (Jelly Bean) devices. For more information
  on enabling this feature see this
  Wireless display support page.
</p>
<h2>Remote Playback</h2>
<p>The remote playback approach sends control commands to a secondary device to initiate playback
  and to control playback that is in progress (pause, rewind, fast-forward, volume up and down).
  Using this approach, the receiving device (such as a Chromecast) is responsible for retrieving
  and rendering content.</p>
<p>When your app supports this type of media route, you must create a <code>RemotePlaybackClient</code> object using a remote playback <code>MediaRouter.RouteInfo</code> object received through your app's
  <code>MediaRouter.Callback</code> object. The following sample
  code demonstrates a controller method that creates a new remote playback client and sends it a
  video for playback:</p>
<p>WHATSON? f1ca456d-c7fc-4241-b68f-dd955425445e</p>
<pre>
private void updateRemotePlayer(RouteInfo route) {
    // Changed route: tear down previous client
    if (mRoute != null &amp;&amp; mRemotePlaybackClient != null) {
        mRemotePlaybackClient.release();
        mRemotePlaybackClient = null;
    }

    // Save new route
    mRoute = route;

    // Attach new playback client
    mRemotePlaybackClient = new RemotePlaybackClient(this, mRoute);

    // Send file for playback
    mRemotePlaybackClient.play(Uri.parse(
            "http://archive.org/download/Sintel/sintel-2048-stereo_512kb.mp4"),
            "video/mp4", null, 0, null, new ItemActionCallback() {

            @Override
            public void onResult(Bundle data, String sessionId,
                    MediaSessionStatus sessionStatus,
                    String itemId, MediaItemStatus itemStatus) {
                logStatus("play: succeeded for item " + itemId);
            }

            @Override
            public void onError(String error, int code, Bundle data) {
                logStatus("play: failed - error:"+ code +" - "+ error);
            }
        });
    }
}
</pre>
<p>The <code>RemotePlaybackClient</code> class provides additional methods
  for managing content playback. Here are a few of the key playback methods from the <code>RemotePlaybackClient</code> class:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>play()</code> — Play a specific
    media file, specified by a <code>Uri</code>.</li>
  <li><code>pause()</code> — Pause the
    currently playing media track.</li>
  <li><code>resume()</code> — Continue
    playing the current track after a pause command.</li>
  <li><code>seek()</code> — Move to a specific
    position in the current track.</li>
  <li><code>release()</code> — Tear down the
    connection from your app to the remote playback device.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use these methods to attach actions to playback controls you provide in your
  app. Most of these methods also allow you to include a callback object so you can monitor
  the progress of the playback task or control request.</p>
<p>
  The <code>RemotePlaybackClient</code> class also supports queueing of
  multiple media items for playback and management of the media queue. For a comprehensive sample
  implementation of these features, see <code>SampleMediaRouterActivity</code> and its associated
  classes in the v7 mediarouter support library sample
  <code>&lt;sdk&gt;/extras/android/compatibility/v7/mediarouter</code>.
</p>
<p>
  For additional information on using the Google Cast API for Chromecast devices, see the
  Google Cast developer documentation.
</p>
<h2>Secondary Output</h2>
<p>The secondary output approach sends prepared media content to a connected secondary device
  for playback. Secondary devices can include televisions or wireless sound systems and can be
  attached through wireless protocols or wires, such as an HDMI cable. With this approach, your
  app is responsible for processing media content for playback (downloading, decoding,
  synchronization of audio and video tracks), while the secondary device only outputs the content
  in its final form.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> Using the secondary output display routes with the media router framework
  requires classes that are available only in Android 4.2 (API level 17) and higher, specifically the
  <code>Presentation</code> class. If you are building an app that supports both
  remote playback and secondary output devices, you must include checks that disable this code
  below the supported Android version level.
</p>
<h3>Creating a Presentation object</h3>
<p>When using a secondary output display with the media router framework, you create a <code>Presentation</code> object that contains the content you want to show on that display. The
  <code>Presentation</code> is extended from the <code>Dialog</code> class, so can
  add layouts and views to a <code>Presentation</code>.</p>
<p>You should be aware that the <code>Presentation</code> object has its own
  <code>Context</code> and
  <code>Resources</code>,
  separate from the app activity that created the object. Having a secondary
  context is required, because the content of the <code>Presentation</code> is drawn on a
  display that is separate from your app's display on the local Android device.
  Specifically, the secondary display needs a separate context because it may need to load
  resources based on its specific screen metrics.</p>
<p>The following code sample shows a minimal implementation of a
  <code>Presentation</code> object, including a <code>GLSurfaceView</code>
  object.</p>
<p>WHATSON? b34a6ed8-828c-4f12-aa68-be3ddb437ff2</p>
<pre>
public class SamplePresentation extends Presentation {
    public SamplePresentation(Context outerContext, Display display) {
        super(outerContext, display);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        // Notice that we get resources from the context of the Presentation
        Resources resources = getContext().getResources();

        // Inflate a layout.
        setContentView(R.layout.presentation_with_media_router_content);

        // Add presentation content here:
        // Set up a surface view for visual interest
        mSurfaceView = (GLSurfaceView)findViewById(R.id.surface_view);
        mSurfaceView.setRenderer(new CubeRenderer(false));
    }
}

<h3>Creating a Presentation controller</h3>
<p>In order to display a <code>Presentation</code> object, you should write a
  controller layer that handles responses to the messages received by the <code>MediaRouter.Callback</code> object and manages the creation and
  removal of the <code>Presentation</code> object. The controller layer should also handle
  attaching presentations to a selected <code>Display</code> object, which represents the
  separate physical display device chosen by the user. The controller layer can simply be a method
  in the activity that supports a secondary display.</p>
<p>The following code sample shows a controller layer for a <code>Presentation</code>
  implemented as a single method. This method handles dismissing invalid presentations when a
  <code>Display</code> is unselected or disconnected, and creates the <code>Presentation</code> object when a display device is connected.</p>

private void updatePresentation(RouteInfo route) {
    // Get its Display if a valid route has been selected
    Display selectedDisplay = null;
    if (route != null) {
        selectedDisplay = route.getPresentationDisplay();
    }

    // Dismiss the current presentation if the display has changed or no new
    // route has been selected
    if (mPresentation != null &amp;&amp; mPresentation.getDisplay() != selectedDisplay) {
        mPresentation.dismiss();
            mPresentation = null;
    }

    // Show a new presentation if the previous one has been dismissed and a
    // route has been selected.
    if (mPresentation == null &amp;&amp; selectedDisplay != null) {
        // Initialize a new Presentation for the Display
        mPresentation = new SamplePresentation(this, selectedDisplay);
        mPresentation.setOnDismissListener(
                new DialogInterface.OnDismissListener() {
                    // Listen for presentation dismissal and then remove it
                    @Override
                    public void onDismiss(DialogInterface dialog) {
                        if (dialog == mPresentation) {
                            mPresentation = null;
                        }
                    }
                });

        // Try to show the presentation, this might fail if the display has
        // gone away in the meantime
        try {
            mPresentation.show();
        } catch (WindowManager.InvalidDisplayException ex) {
            // Couldn't show presentation - display was already removed
            mPresentation = null;
        }
    }

  <strong>Note:</strong> When the a user connects to a Wireless Display, the media router
  framework automatically provides a notification that it is displaying screen content on a
  connected device.
