<pre>
int i = 9;
int j = 13;
int k = i + j;
</pre>
<p>This is done all in a primitive type. Shouldn't the first line, for example, be "Integer i = 9"? -- Taku 01:24, September 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This article doesn't say much about what an object type is. It's trying to explain autoboxing, but not doing a very good job. I'd rather read the Sun article. Can anyone do a better job? --Uncle Ed 21:42, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

Isn't it all about 'object types' living garbage collectably on the heap, and primitive types, structs living on the stack? (at least in c# and java). Boxing is creating a new object on heap out of a stack object so it can be manipulated with a reference - it is unsafe to get a reference to an object living on stack, because it could die too early and program could crash. exe 03:32, 13 May 2007 (UTC)</p>

I think that the part about unboxing mostly speaks about what code constructs different versions of the java compiler/language accepts, and not about the language neutral concept of boxing/unboxing. I think that part should be removed, or at least some of it. (Sorry, no wikipedia account. LarsR) 10:10, 8 Aug 2007 (CET)</p>

Made it a little more generic, and precised that since .Net, not all value types are primitive types.Medinoc (talk) 11:10, 8 October 2008 (UTC)</p>
<h2>Haskell unboxing</h2>
<p>Unboxing redirects here, but this is about how objects work in Java. It doesn't seem to be a suitable place to put something about unboxed types in Haskell, although there is similarity in the underlying concepts. In Haskell everything by default is 'boxed', and a boxed thing could be either the thing itself or some unevaluated expression that could evaluate to something of the correct type (because Haskell is lazy).

<p>Drepnir (talk) 23:08, 26 November 2008 (UTC) Found something wrong:</p>
<p>Another example:<br>
<br>
int i = 4;<br>
int j = 5;<br>
Integer k = new Integer(i + j); // always OK<br>
Integer l = i + j; // would have been an error, but okay now - equivalent to previous line<br>
<br>
<br>
C# does not support automatic unboxing. A boxed object must be explicitly unboxed with a typecasting operator:<br>
<br>
int i = 42;<br>
object o = i; //box<br>
int j = (int)o; //unbox<br>
Console.Writeline(j); //outputs 42<br></p>
<p><br>
It is assumed that the following will compile on Java, but it won't. C# does support automatic unboxing of primitives, but not objects, just like Java.<br>
<br>
int i = 42;<br>
Object o = i; //box<br>
int j = o; //unbox<br>
System.out.println(j); //outputs "42"<br>
<br>
Will not compile because it can't unbox objects of type Object.</p>
<h2>Def, scope, mess</h2>
<p>This article is about boxing, unboxing and autoboxing. The definition of "object type" given here is dubiously narrow. See object type. I think this article should be moved to Boxing, unboxing and autoboxing. Compare with Covariance and contravariance (computer science)... Pcap <small>ping</small> 09:26, 26 August 2009 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree that <i>currently</i> the content of the article is inconsistent with the title. So, the simplest solution, I guess, is to rename it. But I'm afraid the name Boxing, unboxing and autoboxing may narrow the scope of the article too much. The article starts with saying that an object type is a datatype, and so it should be about a general concept, mentioning boxing of a primitive data type as one example, not as a primary subject. The lack of a precise definition is not a good reason for not to have an article. For example, an interpreted language doesn't give a precise definition, but tries to cover context and give a lot of examples. In short, "Object type" may be too vague to be a good title. But "boxing, ..." doesn't seem a good one, either. It suggests a very concrete approach to primitive data types that are not objects. Maybe someone can propose a better title. -- Taku (talk) 11:57, 27 August 2009 (UTC)</p>
