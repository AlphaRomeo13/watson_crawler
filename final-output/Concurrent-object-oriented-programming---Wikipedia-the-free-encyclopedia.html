<h1>Concurrent object-oriented programming</h1>
<p><b>Concurrent object-oriented programming</b> is a programming paradigm which combines object-oriented programming (OOP) together with concurrency. While numerous programming languages, such as Java, combine OOP with concurrency mechanisms like threads, the phrase "concurrent object-oriented programming" primarily refers to systems where objects themselves are a concurrency primitive, such as when objects are combined with the actor model.</p>
