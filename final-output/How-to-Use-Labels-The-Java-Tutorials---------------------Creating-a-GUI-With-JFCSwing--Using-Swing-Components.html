<h1>How to Use Labels</h1>
<p>With the 
<code>JLabel</code> class, you can display unselectable text and images. If you need to create a component that displays a string, an image, or both, you can do so by using or extending <code>JLabel</code>. If the component is interactive and has a certain state, use a button instead of a label.</p>
<p>By specifying HTML code in a label's text, you can give the label various characteristics such as multiple lines, multiple fonts or multiple colors. If the label uses just a single color or font, you can avoid the overhead of HTML processing by using the <code>setForeground</code> or <code>setFont</code> method instead. See Using HTML in Swing Components for details.</p>
<p>Note that labels are not opaque by default. If you need to paint the label's background, it is recommended that you turn its opacity property to "true". The following code snippet shows how to do this.</p>
<p>WHATSON? 3e388e4f-ab9f-4206-8252-7edb8c630e0d</p>
<pre>
label.setOpaque(true);
</pre>
<p>The following picture introduces an application that displays three labels. The window is divided into three rows of equal height; the label in each row is as wide as possible.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the Launch button to run the Label Demo using 
Java™ Web Start (download JDK 7 or later). Alternatively, to compile and run the example yourself, consult the example index.<img src="../../images/jws-launch-button.png" width="88" height="23" align="bottom" alt="Launches the LabelDemo Application"><br></li>
<li>Resize the window so you can see how the labels' contents are placed within the labels' drawing area.<br>
All the label contents have default vertical alignment  that is, the label contents are centered vertically in the label's drawing area. The top label, which contains both an image and text, has horizontal center alignment. The second label, which contains just text, has left (leading) alignment, which is the default for text-only labels in left-to-right languages. The third label, which contains just an image, has horizontal center alignment, which is the default for image-only labels.</li>
</ol>
<p>Below is the code from 
<code>LabelDemo.java</code> that creates the labels in the previous example.</p>
<p>WHATSON? 1aceff6e-96e9-4a8d-a562-60bda9f4ef1c</p>
<pre>
ImageIcon icon = createImageIcon("images/middle.gif");
. . .
label1 = new JLabel("Image and Text",
                    icon,
                    JLabel.CENTER);
//Set the position of the text, relative to the icon:
label1.setVerticalTextPosition(JLabel.BOTTOM);
label1.setHorizontalTextPosition(JLabel.CENTER);

label2 = new JLabel("Text-Only Label");
label3 = new JLabel(icon);
</pre>
<p>The code for the <code>createImageIcon</code> method is similar to that used throughout this tutorial. You can find it in 
How to Use Icons.</p>
<p>Often, a label describes another component. When this occurs, you can improve your program's accessibility by using the <code>setLabelFor</code> method to identify the component that the label describes. For example:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 8337ccca-0f1c-437c-b924-6f0c739fa060</p>
<pre>
amountLabel.setLabelFor(amountField);
</pre>
<p>The preceding code, taken from the <code>FormattedTextFieldDemo</code> example discussed in How to Use Formatted Text Fields, lets assistive technologies know that the label (<code>amountLabel</code>) provides information about the formatted text field (<code>amountField</code>). For more information about assistive technologies, see 
How to Support Assistive Technologies.</p>
<h2>The Label API</h2>
<p>The following tables list the commonly used <code>JLabel</code> constructors and methods. Other methods you are likely to call are defined by the <code>Component</code> and <code>JComponent</code> classes. They include <code>setFont</code>, <code>setForeground</code>, <code>setBorder</code>, <code>setOpaque</code>, and <code>setBackground</code>. See The JComponent Class for details. The API for using labels falls into three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting or Getting the Label's Contents</li>
<li>Fine Tuning the Label's Appearance</li>
<li>Supporting Accessibility</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following API, do not confuse label alignment with X and Y alignment. X and Y alignment are used by layout managers and can affect the way any component  not just a label  is sized or positioned. Label alignment, on the other hand, has no effect on a label's size or position. Label alignment simply determines where, inside the label's painting area, the label's contents are positioned. Typically, the label's painting area is exactly the size needed to paint on the label and thus label alignment is irrelevant. For more information about X and Y alignment, see 
How to Use BoxLayout.</p>
<h2>Examples That Use Labels</h2>
