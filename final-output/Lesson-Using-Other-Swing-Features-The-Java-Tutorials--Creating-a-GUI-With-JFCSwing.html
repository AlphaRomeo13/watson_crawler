<h1>Lesson: Using Other Swing Features</h1>
<p>This lesson contains a collection of how-to pages to help you use miscellaneous Swing features.</p>
<h2>How to Integrate with the Desktop Class</h2>
<p>With the <code>Desktop</code> class you can enable your Java application to interact with default applications associated with specific file types on the host platform.</p>
<h2>How to Create Translucent and Shaped Windows</h2>
<p>As of the Java Platform, Standard Edition 6 Update 10 release, you can add translucent and shaped windows to your Swing applications. This lesson shows you how.</p>
<h2>How to Decorate Components with JLayer</h2>
<p><code>JLayer</code> is a flexible and powerful <i>decorator</i> for Swing components. It enables you to draw on components and respond to component events without modifying the underlying component directly.</p>
<h2>How to Use Actions</h2>
<p>With <code>Action</code> objects, you can coordinate the state and event handling of two or more components that generate action events. For example, you can use a single <code>Action</code> to create and coordinate a tool-bar button and a menu item that perform the same function.</p>
<h2>How to Use Swing Timers</h2>
<p>With the Swing <code>Timer</code> class, you can implement a thread that performs an action after a delay, and optionally continues to repeat the action. The action executes in the event dispatch thread.</p>
<h2>How to Support Assistive Technologies</h2>
<p>Swing components have built-in support for assistive technologies. Your program can provide even better support by following a few rules.</p>
<h2>How to Use the Focus Subsystem</h2>
<p>Some programs need to manipulate focus ??? for example, to validate input, or change the tab-order of components. This section describes some techniques you can use to customize focus in your program.</p>
<h2>How to Use Key Bindings</h2>
<p>With key bindings, you can specify how components react to user typing.</p>
<h2>How to Use Modality in Dialogs</h2>
<p>This section describes a new modality model emerged in the Javaâ„¢ SE version 6 and enables you to apply different modality types to dialog boxes.</p>
<h2>How to Print Tables</h2>
<p>This section describes the printing capabilities for tables and explains how to add printing support to your programs.</p>
<h2>How to Print Text</h2>
<p>This section describes the printing capabilities for text components and explains how to add printing support to your programs.</p>
<h2>How to Create a Splash Screen</h2>
<p>With the <code>SplashScreen</code> class you can close the splash screen, change the splash-screen image, obtain the image position or size, and paint in the splash screen.</p>
<h2>How to Use the System Tray</h2>
<p>This section describes how to add a tray icon to the system tray and apply a text tooltip, a pop-up menu, ballon messages, and a set of listeners associated with it.</p>
<h2>Solving Common Problems Using Other Swing Features</h2>
<p>This section tells you how to fix problems you might encounter while trying to use the information in this lesson.</p>
