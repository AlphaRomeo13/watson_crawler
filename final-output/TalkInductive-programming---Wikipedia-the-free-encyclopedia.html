<h1>Talk:Inductive programming</h1>
<h2>Proposed merge with Inductive functional programming</h2>
<p>too soon. if no more than a paragraph can be produced about the subject, it belongs in the parent article. No need to split out into a dedicated article. RadioFan (talk) 02:15, 11 February 2014 (UTC)</p>
<h2>Text copied from other sources?</h2>
<p>I noticed that at least some of the text hear is copied from other sources, with small amounts of editing. For example, the sentence "The advent of logic programming brought a new elan but also a new direction in the early 1980s, especially due to the MIS system of Shapiro[9] eventually spawning the new field of inductive logic programming (ILP)." is almost exactly equivalent to a sentence in <i>Flener, P.; Schmid, U. (2008). "An introduction to inductive programming". Artificial Intelligence Review (Springer). 29(1): 45â€“62.</i>. I haven't looked closely at the rest, but it would be good to make sure this article isn't mostly plagiarized. --Schneau (talk) 15:32, 4 March 2014 (UTC)</p>
