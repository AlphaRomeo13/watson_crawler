<h1>Additional Resources</h1>
<p>Now that you've completed this lesson on regular expressions, you'll probably find that your main references will be the API documentation for the following classes: 
<code>Pattern</code>, 
<code>Matcher</code>, and 
<code>PatternSyntaxException</code>.</p>
<p>For a more precise description of the behavior of regular expression constructs, we recommend reading the book 
<em>Mastering Regular Expressions</em> by Jeffrey E. F. Friedl.</p>
