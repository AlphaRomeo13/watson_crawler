<h4>Android 4.0 Graphics and Animations</h4>
<p>Earlier this year, Android 3.0 launched with a new 2D rendering pipeline designed to
support hardware acceleration on tablets. With this new pipeline, all drawing operations performed
by the UI toolkit are carried out using the GPU. You’ll be happy to hear that Android 4.0, Ice Cream
Sandwich, brings an improved version of the hardware-accelerated 2D rendering pipeline.</p>
<h4>Introducing ViewPropertyAnimator</h4>
<p>This new animation system makes it easy to animate any kind of property on any object,
including the new properties added to the View class in 3.0. In the 3.1 release, we added a small
utility class that makes animating these properties even easier.</p>
<h4>Android 3.0 Hardware Acceleration</h4>
<p>Hardware accelerated graphics is nothing new to the Android platform, it has always been
used for windows composition or OpenGL games for instance, but with this new rendering pipeline
applications can benefit from an extra boost in performance.</p>
<h3>Training</h3>
<h4>Displaying Bitmaps Efficiently</h4>
<p>This class covers some common techniques for processing and loading Bitmap objects in a way
that keeps your user interface (UI) components responsive and avoids exceeding your application
memory limit.</p>
