There are two ways to make a broadcast receiver known to the system:  One is
declare it in the manifest file with this element.  The other is to create
the receiver dynamically in code and register it with the <code><code>Context.registerReceiver()</code></code>
method.  See the <code>BroadcastReceiver</code> class description
for more on dynamically created receivers.
</p>
<p>
The <code>&lt;application&gt;</code> element has its own 
<code>enabled</code> attribute that applies to all 
application components, including broadcast receivers.  The 
<code>&lt;application&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;receiver&gt;</code> attributes must both be "<code>true</code>" for 
the broadcast receiver to be enabled.  If either is "<code>false</code>", it is
disabled; it cannot be instantiated.
</p>
<p>
The default value depends on whether the broadcast receiver contains intent filters.  
The absence of any filters means that it can be invoked only by Intent objects that
specify its exact class name.  This implies that the receiver is intended only for 
application-internal use (since others would not normally know the class name).  
So in this case, the default value is "<code>false</code>".
On the other hand, the presence of at least one filter implies that the broadcast 
receiver is intended to receive intents broadcast by the system or other applications, 
so the default value is "<code>true</code>".
</p>
<p>
This attribute is not the only way to limit a broadcast receiver's external exposure.  
You can also use a permission to limit the external entities that can send it messages 
(see the <code>permission</code> attribute).
</p>
<p>
The broadcast receiver's icon — whether set here or by the 
<code>&lt;application&gt;</code> element — is also the 
default icon for all the receiver's intent filters (see the 
<code>&lt;intent-filter&gt;</code> element's 
<code>icon</code> attribute). 
</p>
<p>
The broadcast receiver's label — whether set here or by the 
<code>&lt;application&gt;</code> element — is also the 
default label for all the receiver's intent filters (see the 
<code>&lt;intent-filter&gt;</code> element's 
<code>label</code> attribute). 
</p>
<p>
The label should be set as a reference to a string resource, so that
it can be localized like other strings in the user interface.  
However, as a convenience while you're developing the application, 
it can also be set as a raw string.
</p>
<p>Once you publish your application, you should not
change this name (unless you've set <code>android:exported="false"</code>).</p>
<p>
There is no default.  The name must be specified.
</p>
<p>
For more information on permissions, see the 
Permissions 
section in the introduction and a separate document, 
Security and Permissions.
</p>
<p>
If the name assigned to this attribute begins with a colon (':'), a new 
process, private to the application, is created when it's needed and 
the broadcast receiver runs in that process.
If the process name begins with a lowercase character, the receiver will run 
in a global process of that name, provided that it has permission to do so.
This allows components in different applications to share a process, reducing 
resource usage.
