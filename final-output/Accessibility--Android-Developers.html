<p>Many Android users have different abilities that require them to interact with their Android
devices in different ways. These include users who have visual, physical or age-related limitations
that prevent them from fully seeing or using a touchscreen, and users with hearing loss who may not
be able to perceive audible information and alerts.</p>
<p>Android provides accessibility features and services for helping these users navigate their
devices more easily, including text-to-speech, haptic feedback, gesture navigation, trackball and
directional-pad navigation. Android application developers can take advantage of these services to
make their applications more accessible.</p>
<p>Android developers can also build their own accessibility services, which can provide
enhanced usability features such as audio prompting, physical feedback, and alternative navigation
modes. Accessibility services can provide these enhancements for all applications, a set of
applications or just a single app.</p>
<p>The following topics show you how to use the Android framework to make applications more
accessible.</p>
