<h1>I/O Streams</h1>
<p>An <em>I/O Stream</em> represents an input source or an output destination. A stream can represent many different kinds of sources and destinations, including disk files, devices, other programs, and memory arrays.</p>
<p>Streams support many different kinds of data, including simple bytes, primitive data types, localized characters, and objects. Some streams simply pass on data; others manipulate and transform the data in useful ways.</p>
<p>No matter how they work internally, all streams present the same simple model to programs that use them: A stream is a sequence of data. A program uses an <i>input stream</i> to read data from a source, one item at a time:</p>
<p>Reading information into a program.</p>
<p>A program uses an <i>output stream</i> to write data to a destination, one item at time:</p>
<p>Writing information from a program.</p>
<p>In this lesson, we'll see streams that can handle all kinds of data, from primitive values to advanced objects.</p>
<p>The data source and data destination pictured above can be anything that holds, generates, or consumes data. Obviously this includes disk files, but a source or destination can also be another program, a peripheral device, a network socket, or an array.</p>
<p>In the next section, we'll use the most basic kind of streams, byte streams, to demonstrate the common operations of Stream I/O. For sample input, we'll use the example file 
<code>xanadu.txt</code>, which contains the following verse:</p>
<p>WHATSON? fc1deb2a-67c5-4eaf-9c48-7021d5c16392</p>
<pre>
In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
A stately pleasure-dome decree:
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
Through caverns measureless to man
Down to a sunless sea.
