<h1>Predicate (mathematical logic)</h1>
<p>In mathematics, a <b>predicate</b> is commonly understood to be a Boolean-valued function <i>P</i>: <i>X</i>â†’ {true, false}, called the predicate on <i>X</i>. However, predicates have many different uses and interpretations in mathematics and logic, and their precise definition, meaning and use will vary from theory to theory. So, for example, when a theory defines the concept of a relation, then a predicate is simply the characteristic function or the indicator function of a relation. However, not all theories have relations, or are founded on set theory, and so one must be careful with the proper definition and semantic interpretation of a predicate.</p>

<h2>Simplified overview</h2>
<p>Informally, a <b>predicate</b> is a statement that may be true or false depending on the values of its variables. It can be thought of as an operator or function that returns a value that is either true or false. For example, predicates are sometimes used to indicate set membership: when talking about sets, it is sometimes inconvenient or impossible to describe a set by listing all of its elements. Thus, a predicate <i>P(x)</i> will be true or false, depending on whether <i>x</i> belongs to a set.</p>
<p>Predicates are also commonly used to talk about the properties of objects, by defining the set of all objects that have some property in common. So, for example, when <i>P</i> is a predicate on <i>X</i>, one might sometimes say <i>P</i> is a property of <i>X</i>. Similarly, the notation <i>P</i>(<i>x</i>) is used to denote a sentence or statement <i>P</i> concerning the variable object x. The set defined by <i>P</i>(<i>x</i>) is written as {<i>x</i> | <i>P</i>(<i>x</i>)}, and is just a collection of all the objects for which <i>P</i> is true.</p>
<p>For instance, {<i>x</i> | <i>x</i> is a positive integer less than 4} is the set {1,2,3}.</p>
<p>If <i>t</i> is an element of the set {<i>x</i> | <i>P</i>(<i>x</i>)}, then the statement <i>P</i>(<i>t</i>) is <i>true</i>.</p>
<p>Here, <i>P</i>(<i>x</i>) is referred to as the <i>predicate</i>, and <i>x</i> the <i>subject</i> of the <i>proposition</i>. Sometimes, <i>P</i>(<i>x</i>) is also called a propositional function, as each choice of x produces a proposition.</p>
<h2>Formal definition</h2>
<p>The precise semantic interpretation of an atomic formula and an atomic sentence will vary from theory to theory.</p>
<ul>
<li>In propositional logic, atomic formulas are called propositional variables. In a sense, these are nullary (i.e. 0-arity) predicates.</li>
<li>In first-order logic, an atomic formula consists of a predicate symbol applied to an appropriate number of terms.</li>
<li>In set theory, predicates are understood to be characteristic functions or set indicator functions, <i>i.e.</i> functions from a set element to a truth value. Set-builder notation makes use of predicates to define sets.</li>
<li>In autoepistemic logic, which rejects the law of excluded middle, predicates may be true, false, or simply <i>unknown</i>; <i>i.e.</i> a given collection of facts may be insufficient to determine the truth or falsehood of a predicate.</li>
<li>In fuzzy logic, predicates are the characteristic functions of a probability distribution. That is, the strict true/false valuation of the predicate is replaced by a quantity interpreted as the degree of truth.</li>
