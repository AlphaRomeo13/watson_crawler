<h1>How to Use Password Fields</h1>
<p>The 
<code>JPasswordField</code> class, a subclass of <code>JTextField</code>, provides specialized text fields for password entry. For security reasons, a password field does not show the characters that the user types. Instead, the field displays a character different from the one typed, such as an asterisk '*'. As another security precaution, a password field stores its value as an array of characters, rather than as a string. Like an ordinary text field, a password field fires an 
action event when the user indicates that text entry is complete, for example by pressing the Enter button.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of a demo that opens a small window and prompts the user to type in a password.</p>
<p>Click the Launch button to run PasswordDemo using 
Javaâ„¢ Web Start  (download JDK 7 or later). Alternatively, to compile and run the example yourself, consult the example index.</p>
<p>The password is "bugaboo". The password "bugaboo" is an example only. Use secure authentication methods in production systems. You can find the entire code for this program in 
<code><code>PasswordDemo.java</code></code>. Here is the code that creates and sets up the password field:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 84ff1c2b-8929-4d1a-9a38-3f89775b6e6e</p>
<pre>
passwordField = new JPasswordField(10);
passwordField.setActionCommand(OK);
passwordField.addActionListener(this);
</pre>
<p>The argument passed into the <code>JPasswordField</code> constructor indicates the preferred size of the field, which is at least 10 columns wide in this case. By default a password field displays a dot for each character typed. If you want to change the echo character, call the <code>setEchoChar</code> method. The code then adds an action listener to the password field, which checks the value typed in by the user. Here is the implementation of the action listener's <code>actionPerformed</code> method:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 18f539fc-1a2f-4177-b6ea-3b42b4d75886</p>
<pre>
public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
    String cmd = e.getActionCommand();

    if (OK.equals(cmd)) { //Process the password.
        <b>char[] input = passwordField.getPassword();</b>
        if (isPasswordCorrect(input)) {
            JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(controllingFrame,
                "Success! You typed the right password.");
        } else {
            JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(controllingFrame,
                "Invalid password. Try again.",
                "Error Message",
                JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE);
        }

        //Zero out the possible password, for security.
        Arrays.fill(input, '0');

        passwordField.selectAll();
        resetFocus();
    } else <em>...//handle the Help button...</em>
}
</pre>
<p>A program that uses a password field typically validates the password before completing any actions that require the password. This program calls a private method, <code>isPasswordCorrect</code>, that compares the value returned by the <code>getPassword</code> method to a value stored in a character array. Here is its code:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 34469b14-28d5-40c0-98e1-2f4a60ddf633</p>
<pre>
private static boolean isPasswordCorrect(char[] input) {
    boolean isCorrect = true;
    char[] correctPassword = { 'b', 'u', 'g', 'a', 'b', 'o', 'o' };

    if (input.length != correctPassword.length) {
        isCorrect = false;
    } else {
        isCorrect = Arrays.equals (input, correctPassword);
    }

    //Zero out the password.
    Arrays.fill(correctPassword,'0');

    return isCorrect;
}
</pre>
<h2>The Password Field API</h2>
<p>The following tables list the commonly used <code>JPasswordField</code> constructors and methods. For information on the API that password fields inherit, see How to Use Text Fields.</p>
<h2>Examples That Use Password Fields</h2>
<p>PasswordDemo is the Tutorial's only example that uses a <code>JPasswordField</code> object. However, the Tutorial has many examples that use <code>JTextField</code> objects, whose API is inherited by <code>JPasswordField</code>. See Examples That Use Text Fields for further information.</p>
