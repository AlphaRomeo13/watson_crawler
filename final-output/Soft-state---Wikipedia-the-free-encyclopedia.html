<h1>Soft state</h1>
<p>In computer science, <b>soft state</b> is state which is useful for efficiency, but not essential, as it can be regenerated or replaced if needed. The term is often used in network protocol engineering.</p>
<p>It is a term that is used for 'information that times out (goes away) unless refreshed.</p>
<p>While in general less efficient than well-designed "hard state" protocols when tuned for a particular network regime, soft state protocols behave much better than hard state protocols in an unpredictable network environment such as the Internet.</p>
