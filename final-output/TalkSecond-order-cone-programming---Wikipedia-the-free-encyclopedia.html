<h2>Expert needed?</h2>
<p>There is an expert tag on this page but I cannot see where it is really needed. I'd like to get some feedback before deleting the tag. Zfeinst (talk) 20:14, 15 October 2011 (UTC)</p>
<h2>Can someone add a picture?</h2>
<p>I don't want to read all these boring maths. Please add a picture that explains the problem and solution. 128.196.56.50 (talk) 20:33, 28 January 2014 (UTC)</p>
