<h1>Data Streams</h1>
<p>Data streams support binary I/O of primitive data type values (<code>boolean</code>, <code>char</code>, <code>byte</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>float</code>, and <code>double</code>) as well as String values. All data streams implement either the 
<code>DataInput</code> interface or the 
<code>DataOutput</code> interface. This section focuses on the most widely-used implementations of these interfaces, 
<code>DataInputStream</code> and 
<code>DataOutputStream</code>.</p>
<p>The 
<code>DataStreams</code> example demonstrates data streams by writing out a set of data records, and then reading them in again. Each record consists of three values related to an item on an invoice, as shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Let's examine crucial code in <code>DataStreams</code>. First, the program defines some constants containing the name of the data file and the data that will be written to it:</p>
<p>WHATSON? ba272b1e-b212-42e8-9fed-2b8e9fb17a49</p>
<pre>
static final String dataFile = "invoicedata";

static final double[] prices = { 19.99, 9.99, 15.99, 3.99, 4.99 };
static final int[] units = { 12, 8, 13, 29, 50 };
static final String[] descs = {
    "Java T-shirt",
    "Java Mug",
    "Duke Juggling Dolls",
    "Java Pin",
    "Java Key Chain"
};
</pre>
<p>Then <code>DataStreams</code> opens an output stream. Since a <code>DataOutputStream</code> can only be created as a wrapper for an existing byte stream object, <code>DataStreams</code> provides a buffered file output byte stream.</p>
<p>WHATSON? d1a70682-1111-4d12-8745-2d9e10f632e2</p>
<pre>
out = new DataOutputStream(new BufferedOutputStream(
              new FileOutputStream(dataFile)));
</pre>
<p><code>DataStreams</code> writes out the records and closes the output stream.</p>
<p>WHATSON? 5831c50f-4b28-4148-82b0-b9b1d7244f6b</p>
<pre>
for (int i = 0; i &lt; prices.length; i ++) {
    out.writeDouble(prices[i]);
    out.writeInt(units[i]);
    out.writeUTF(descs[i]);
}
</pre>
<p>The <code>writeUTF</code> method writes out <code>String</code> values in a modified form of UTF-8. This is a variable-width character encoding that only needs a single byte for common Western characters.</p>
<p>Now <code>DataStreams</code> reads the data back in again. First it must provide an input stream, and variables to hold the input data. Like <code>DataOutputStream</code>, <code>DataInputStream</code> must be constructed as a wrapper for a byte stream.</p>
<p>WHATSON? f17d93d2-da3a-478f-987e-4b1a747f73bd</p>
<pre>
in = new DataInputStream(new
            BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(dataFile)));

double price;
int unit;
String desc;
double total = 0.0;
</pre>
<p>Now <code>DataStreams</code> can read each record in the stream, reporting on the data it encounters.</p>
<p>WHATSON? 2eaf9eda-e5fc-41c7-8ff2-f3e31babb918</p>
<pre>
try {
    while (true) {
        price = in.readDouble();
        unit = in.readInt();
        desc = in.readUTF();
        System.out.format("You ordered %d" + " units of %s at $%.2f%n",
            unit, desc, price);
        total += unit * price;
    }
} catch (EOFException e) {
}
</pre>
<p>Notice that <code>DataStreams</code> detects an end-of-file condition by catching 
<code>EOFException</code>, instead of testing for an invalid return value. All implementations of <code>DataInput</code> methods use <code>EOFException</code> instead of return values.</p>
<p>Also notice that each specialized <code>write</code> in <code>DataStreams</code> is exactly matched by the corresponding specialized <code>read</code>. It is up to the programmer to make sure that output types and input types are matched in this way: The input stream consists of simple binary data, with nothing to indicate the type of individual values, or where they begin in the stream.</p>
<p><code>DataStreams</code> uses one very bad programming technique: it uses floating point numbers to represent monetary values. In general, floating point is bad for precise values. It's particularly bad for decimal fractions, because common values (such as <code>0.1</code>) do not have a binary representation.</p>
<p>The correct type to use for currency values is 
<code>java.math.BigDecimal</code>. Unfortunately, <code>BigDecimal</code> is an object type, so it won't work with data streams. However, <code>BigDecimal</code> <i>will</i> work with object streams, which are covered in the next section.</p>
