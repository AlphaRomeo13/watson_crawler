<h1>Character Classes</h1>
<p>If you browse through the 
<code>Pattern</code> class specification, you'll see tables summarizing the supported regular expression constructs. In the "Character Classes" section you'll find the following:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The left-hand column specifies the regular expression constructs, while the right-hand column describes the conditions under which each construct will match.</p>
<h2>Simple Classes</h2>
<p>The most basic form of a character class is to simply place a set of characters side-by-side within square brackets. For example, the regular expression <code>[bcr]at</code> will match the words "bat", "cat", or "rat" because it defines a character class (accepting either "b", "c", or "r") as its first character.</p>
<p>WHATSON? 51a9a3ed-69c1-4bdd-b2e5-d664464ed368</p>
<pre> 
Enter your regex: [bcr]at
Enter input string to search: bat
I found the text "bat" starting at index 0 and ending at index 3.

Enter your regex: [bcr]at
Enter input string to search: cat
I found the text "cat" starting at index 0 and ending at index 3.

Enter your regex: [bcr]at
Enter input string to search: rat
I found the text "rat" starting at index 0 and ending at index 3.

Enter your regex: [bcr]at
Enter input string to search: hat
No match found.
</pre>
<p>In the above examples, the overall match succeeds only when the first letter matches one of the characters defined by the character class.</p>
<h3>Negation</h3>
<p>To match all characters <i>except</i> those listed, insert the "<code>^</code>" metacharacter at the beginning of the character class. This technique is known as <i>negation</i>.</p>
<p>WHATSON? c8c0bf9c-b3f9-44ea-96f9-ccd7e5015f3c</p>
<pre> 
Enter your regex: [^bcr]at
Enter input string to search: bat
No match found.

Enter your regex: [^bcr]at
Enter input string to search: cat
No match found.

Enter your regex: [^bcr]at
Enter input string to search: rat
No match found.

Enter your regex: [^bcr]at
Enter input string to search: hat
I found the text "hat" starting at index 0 and ending at index 3.
</pre>
<p>The match is successful only if the first character of the input string does <i>not</i> contain any of the characters defined by the character class.</p>
<h3>Ranges</h3>
<p>Sometimes you'll want to define a character class that includes a range of values, such as the letters "a through h" or the numbers "1 through 5". To specify a range, simply insert the "<code>-</code>" metacharacter between the first and last character to be matched, such as <code>[1-5]</code> or <code>[a-h]</code>. You can also place different ranges beside each other within the class to further expand the match possibilities. For example, <code>[a-zA-Z]</code> will match any letter of the alphabet: a to z (lowercase) or A to Z (uppercase).</p>
<p>Here are some examples of ranges and negation:</p>
<p>WHATSON? 56b005cc-bf1e-4ab6-bc54-197fd927cf55</p>
<pre>
Enter your regex: [a-c]
Enter input string to search: a
I found the text "a" starting at index 0 and ending at index 1.

Enter your regex: [a-c]
Enter input string to search: b
I found the text "b" starting at index 0 and ending at index 1.

Enter your regex: [a-c]
Enter input string to search: c
I found the text "c" starting at index 0 and ending at index 1.

Enter your regex: [a-c]
Enter input string to search: d
No match found.

Enter your regex: foo[1-5]
Enter input string to search: foo1
I found the text "foo1" starting at index 0 and ending at index 4.

Enter your regex: foo[1-5]
Enter input string to search: foo5
I found the text "foo5" starting at index 0 and ending at index 4.

Enter your regex: foo[1-5]
Enter input string to search: foo6
No match found.

Enter your regex: foo[^1-5]
Enter input string to search: foo1
No match found.

Enter your regex: foo[^1-5]
Enter input string to search: foo6
I found the text "foo6" starting at index 0 and ending at index 4.
</pre>
<h3>Unions</h3>
<p>You can also use <i>unions</i> to create a single character class comprised of two or more separate character classes. To create a union, simply nest one class inside the other, such as <code>[0-4[6-8]]</code>. This particular union creates a single character class that matches the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8.</p>
<p>WHATSON? bd5998c9-6ce6-47bf-9370-28c00998cf01</p>
<pre>
Enter your regex: [0-4[6-8]]
Enter input string to search: 0
I found the text "0" starting at index 0 and ending at index 1.

Enter your regex: [0-4[6-8]]
Enter input string to search: 5
No match found.

Enter your regex: [0-4[6-8]]
Enter input string to search: 6
I found the text "6" starting at index 0 and ending at index 1.

Enter your regex: [0-4[6-8]]
Enter input string to search: 8
I found the text "8" starting at index 0 and ending at index 1.

Enter your regex: [0-4[6-8]]
Enter input string to search: 9
No match found.
</pre>
<h3>Intersections</h3>
<p>To create a single character class matching only the characters common to all of its nested classes, use <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, as in <code>[0-9&amp;&amp;[345]]</code>. This particular intersection creates a single character class matching only the numbers common to both character classes: 3, 4, and 5.</p>
<p>WHATSON? 69738948-efe3-490e-bd73-d2f9f9769763</p>
<pre> 
Enter your regex: [0-9&amp;&amp;[345]]
Enter input string to search: 3
I found the text "3" starting at index 0 and ending at index 1.

Enter your regex: [0-9&amp;&amp;[345]]
Enter input string to search: 4
I found the text "4" starting at index 0 and ending at index 1.

Enter your regex: [0-9&amp;&amp;[345]]
Enter input string to search: 5
I found the text "5" starting at index 0 and ending at index 1.

Enter your regex: [0-9&amp;&amp;[345]]
Enter input string to search: 2
No match found.

Enter your regex: [0-9&amp;&amp;[345]]
Enter input string to search: 6
No match found.
</pre>
<p>And here's an example that shows the intersection of two ranges:</p>
<p>WHATSON? b1f6c554-3204-4c0b-aa7c-a6681dd4d666</p>
<pre> 
Enter your regex: [2-8&amp;&amp;[4-6]]
Enter input string to search: 3
No match found.

Enter your regex: [2-8&amp;&amp;[4-6]]
Enter input string to search: 4
I found the text "4" starting at index 0 and ending at index 1.

Enter your regex: [2-8&amp;&amp;[4-6]]
Enter input string to search: 5
I found the text "5" starting at index 0 and ending at index 1.

Enter your regex: [2-8&amp;&amp;[4-6]]
Enter input string to search: 6
I found the text "6" starting at index 0 and ending at index 1.

Enter your regex: [2-8&amp;&amp;[4-6]]
Enter input string to search: 7
No match found.
</pre>
<h3>Subtraction</h3>
<p>Finally, you can use <i>subtraction</i> to negate one or more nested character classes, such as <code>[0-9&amp;&amp;[^345]]</code>. This example creates a single character class that matches everything from 0 to 9, <i>except</i> the numbers 3, 4, and 5.</p>
