<h1>Business object</h1>
<p>A <b>business object</b> is a type of an intelligible entity being an actor inside the business layer in an n-layered architecture of object-oriented computer programs.</p>

<h2>Function</h2>
<p>Whereas a program may implement classes, which typically end in objects managing or executing behaviors, a <i>business object</i> usually does nothing itself but holds a set of instance variables or properties, also known as <i>attributes</i>, and associations with other business objects, weaving a map of objects representing the business relationships.</p>
<p>A domain model where <i>business objects</i> do not have behaviour is called an anemic domain model.</p>
<p>Business objects separate state from behavior because they are communicated across the tiers in a multi-tiered system, while the real work of the application is done in the business tier and does not move across the tiers.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>For example, a "Principal" would be a <i>business object</i> where its attributes can be "Name", "Second name", "Age", "Area", "Country" and it could hold an <i>1-n</i> association with its employees (a collection of <i>Employee</i> instances).</p>
<p>Another example would be a concept like "Process" having "Identifier", "Name", "Start date", "End date" and "Kind" attributes and holding an association with the "Employee" (<i>the responsible</i>) that started it.</p>
