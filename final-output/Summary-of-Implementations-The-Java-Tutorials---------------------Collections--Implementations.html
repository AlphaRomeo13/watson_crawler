<h1>Summary of Implementations</h1>
<p>Implementations are the data objects used to store collections, which implement the interfaces described in the 
Interfaces lesson.</p>
<p>The Java Collections Framework provides several general-purpose implementations of the core interfaces:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the <code>Set</code> interface, <code>HashSet</code> is the most commonly used implementation.</li>
<li>For the <code>List</code> interface, <code>ArrayList</code> is the most commonly used implementation.</li>
<li>For the <code>Map</code> interface, <code>HashMap</code> is the most commonly used implementation.</li>
<li>For the <code>Queue</code> interface, <code>LinkedList</code> is the most commonly used implementation.</li>
<li>For the <code>Deque</code> interface, <code>ArrayDeque</code> is the most commonly used implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the general-purpose implementations provides all optional operations contained in its interface.</p>
<p>The Java Collections Framework also provides several special-purpose implementations for situations that require nonstandard performance, usage restrictions, or other unusual behavior.</p>
<p>The <code>java.util.concurrent</code> package contains several collections implementations, which are thread-safe but not governed by a single exclusion lock.</p>
<p>The <code>Collections</code> class (as opposed to the <code>Collection</code> interface), provides static methods that operate on or return collections, which are known as Wrapper implementations.</p>
<p>Finally, there are several Convenience implementations, which can be more efficient than general-purpose implementations when you don't need their full power. The Convenience implementations are made available through static factory methods.</p>
